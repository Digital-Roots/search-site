            0004- it’s good to be here at Netroots, here to say that whether it is fighting HB 6, HB 56 in Alabama or it’s finding that anti birth control bill they call personhood in Mississippi or fighting for marriage equality and it would have outlawed birth control too. We’re fighting for marriage equality in North Carolina and across this country the NAACP is committed to being a good ally and I’m here to say thank you to all of you who spoke for Troy Davis, who spoke out about the injustice in Georgia together we made the hashtag too much doubt the number one social issue tweeted about in 2011. The second thing only to Beyoncé’s pregnancy, but because of that, because of that out reach, because of that engagement, because Russell Simmons was tweeting about it and all y’all were tweeting about it and even Kim Kardashian was tweeting about it. People in this county had to think about the death penalty and you know what happened? Public support for the death penalty has fallen as a result to its lowest level since it was abolished in 1972 and as a result we just abolish it several weeks ago in Connecticut and things go right this fall will abolish it in California and next year we’ll do it in the great state, oh, the great state od Maryland where I live what that mean y’all is that we are actually within sight of abolishing it all together in our country. We all we got to get to 26 states and we are at 17 now headed towards 19 and its because of the activism, of people in this room thank you but if we had hoped that maybe we were in the early days of a post racial nation from Troy Davis to hate crimes in Tulsa Oklahoma to Trayvon Martin. We understand that we are not there yet. I believe that day may come one day but a fear wont be any day too soon. Right now, we are building and rebuilding if we’re honest a massive campaign to end racial profiling in this country. I say rebuilding because if you think back more than a decade even George W Bush was campaigning against racial profiling in 1999 my children don’t remember that in fact our children haven’t even heard us talk really as a country about racial profiling until the past few months and so we have to keep that conversation going and we need all of you involved in it we all of us involved in it. If racial profiling could be ended by the NAACP trust me we would have done it a long time ago it can be ended by this country and we’re an import part of it but its going to take all of us doing it if you’ll bear with me I want to reflect a moment I want to offer some reflections about what’s been on my mind is we’ve been traveling from Trayvon Martin rally to Trayvon Martin rally across this country waking up this nation and giving voice to a generation that has seen racial profiling go through the roots as they’ve grown up and yet heard very little discussion of it. I you look at these young people, think about how they start their day each morning at school reciting together one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I’ll remind us of that pledge for three reasons, the first is that the simplest most succinctly social contract that blinds us as a nation. 0457- It is literally the simplest representation of the collective aspirations of the progressive movement for generations in this country and at the center of its is the notion of justice with liberty property rights for all democratic rights, justice, civil rights, right in the middle of that trilogy. Justice is the first purpose of our Constitution. Justice is the first ambition of the great revolution that gave birth to this country. I’m talking about the first Tea Party, talking about Bunker Hill, talking about the Boston Massacre that gave us our first Trayvon Martin. Crispus Atticus. There was a time when the entire country was outrages about police brutality but it was a long time ago. The third reason that I mentioned, the pledge is because for our youngest children like my daughter who’s 6 years old like we were decades ago. That pledge isn’t just some secular prayer that they recite every day its actually where they think they live under one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. If we have a duty as citizens as parent’s it is to ensure that social contract is enforce- it is to ensure that our nation actually achieves. It’s aspirations of being as Frederick Douglass said over a hundred something years ago in his street against the Chinese Exclusion Act the HP 56 of his day--that our destiny as a nation is to be the most perfect example of human unity of the world has ever seen it is our duty in other words to build a nation that empowers our children towards their dreams more and more the older they get. And not one that reveals its own hypocrisy and breaks out hearts more and more the older they get in cities like New York City I want to talk about to stop and frisk program for a minute and Mayor Bloomberg cities like New York City. Literally, children say that pledge in the morning- one nation, liberty and justice for all of us and then they walk out the school door or even through their school hallway and they are suspected and mistreated, thrown up against the wall, hand shocked in their pockets sometimes sexually assaulted because of their color not their character. Raise your hand if you remember the Amadou Diallo case that year. We though that New York City’s notorious Street Crimes Unite was out of control because NYPD did 80,000 stop and frisk that year and about ninety percent of the people of color and about ninety percent of them didn’t even have a gun and yet they were treated like they were criminals and a hundred percent of them felt humiliated most of those innocent people and we said well. 0854- Giuliani’s only 80,000 these it’s out of of control, this year Mayor Bloomberg is on pace to do 800,000. Last year he did 685,000. How many guns did he get? This Mayor who is so on fire, he right about stand your ground, he’s right about that. He is wrong about stop and fix how many guns did he get for the 6865,000 stops 760. 760. How many hundreds of thousands of young people have had their self-image assaulted and their hearts broken or pushed into depression because they were jacked up and treated like a criminal because of the color – walking down the street we will never know. But we do know that in New York City last year there were more stops and frisks of black men between the ages of 14 and 24 then there are black boys and men between the ages of 14 and 24 in the entire city the lie that he tells us again and again is that we have to do this because it makes us safer. He’s very proud that New York City has lowered violent crime by 29 percent in the past 10 years. What he doesn’t want you to know is that in the same period, without using this aggressive form of street level racial profiling and targeting of young people because of their color, Los Angeles has lowered violent crime by 59 percent, New Orleans by 56 percent, Dallas by 49 percent, Columbia South Carolina by 45 percent, Baltimore about 37 percent which begs the question, Mayor Bloomberg, why aren’t you doing with their Jordan focusing on fighting crime rather than jacking up our kids now the danger of that argument is that it will live well so some people into accepting the oppression of our young people accepting a police state and what the real tea party understood back in 1776 is that people who as soon as they had oppressed people as soon as they accept their own oppression. Their oppression becomes permanent what Jack Kemp understood when he and I were in Los Angeles over ten years ago dealing with the I think that the 10th anniversary of the riots after Rodney King was that all these children who are being mistreated are all our children we were standing in South LA. That’s right and I offer camp because he was a Republican and many people here, I understand are not Republicans. But Jack was standing there and his shirt sleeves rolled up and he was on fire and he was talking about our kids. Our kids and this black woman standing next to me looked at him, looked at me, looked at him, she leans over to me and said ‘um he’s not from here is he’ I said no ma’am that’s Jack he once ran for president, that’s maybe where you saw him. He said no no no no no yeah I know who he is but I mean whose kids is he talking about, he’s in for South LA and I said ma’am I understand what you say I think is pulling is that they are all our kids because we are all citizens of this country and we all have a responsibility to ensure they are treated with dignity and have a great future and that’s why I was so proud to stand with leaders. 12;53- The LGBT community of the Stonewall Inn last week with 35 LGBT organizations and now is that they will be with us on father’s day when we match to Mr. Bloomberg’s house calling for an end to stop and frisk and so I’m going to ask folks to get ready to stand up here for a second. A man asked them to stand up, stand up if you have ever been racially profiled. Please join me in standing up because I’ve been racially profiled. Stand up id somebody you love- a friend, child, has been racially profiled stand up if you’re worried about somebody in your life being racially profiled look at these folks if you’re not standing up and ask yourself are you willing to stand up for them with them for their children please stand up by standing together. Standing up together against assault on a woman’s right to choose gets assault on our environment because its assault on worker’s rights and standing up together against the American original sin of racism and racial profiling and all the other lies that it spawns. That is the way that we will hasten the future together that is the way that we will make a better America for all our children because they are all our children and that is how we will make this country finally and forever one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all, thank you and God Bless.

            0028 Jealous- to quote him is to pull this country back together to deal with this country as it is and we are very clear at doing that. We have a zero tolerance policy for racial discrimination no matter who does it and we believe that civil rights …(Anderson interrupts)... we saw a statement that we believed was a condense version of the truth, that was shorter than the actual statement but true. We responded quickly because as we do in this line of work where we’re called to respond to video evidence all the time, make very quick judgments, we made a quick set of calls it was late at night as you may recall our statement came out at one am that we were dealing with this, we woke up some people in Georgia, we tried to figure what was going on, we looked at it and we said you know what there is just no way to condone this, what we didn’t realize is that it had been spliced and diced six ways from Sunday so as to completely hide this beautiful story of transformation that you will see if you go to our website and you look at the full video.  0158 Jealous- you know if they had said the things that they said at any NAACP event we would have we are very sensitive to people saying that something was done wrong at one of our events we have hundreds of these dinners across the country put on by volunteers and tore one I travel to dozens of them each year they are beautiful events this one was a beautiful transformational moment of someone telling a story that the country needs to hear. 0231- Jealous you know, take the tea party for instance we studied them for months before we saying something we looked into them very seriously we are dealing with them because forty percent of the country says that or at least recently 40 percent of the country said that they sympathize with them 17 percent said that they actively support them and they are an insurgent right wing populous movement with far right extremists, um parts of it that we haven’t seen in a very long time and yet they have a terrific opportunity to lead this country to a better place as far as conservative politics if they could just get those extremists out like they have started to do so you know that is very serious and methodical, now you take a group like the new black panther the people from the Southern County Law center have spoke on, look they are a hate group they have been very clear about that everything that they say suggests that is all they are they are extremely tiny and they have not spoken at our events and they have not said these horrible things if they did we would certainly be out there I have been very clear bout condemning that one of the things that Mr. Brightbard does is that they don’t really have a relationship with the truth center that we have gone through the past few weeks I have condemned the new black panther party multiple times I will do it here tonight the things that they have said about killing cracker babies and stuff are horrible are horrible. 422- Jealous yeah the- look, call and response is apart of our culture and so is testifying and witnessing and what clear when you look at the whole video which you can see at NAACP.org is that somebody has stood up to testify about you know when they almost went the wrong way and they almost went the wrong way and they decided to go the right way and the audience was following that story from beginning to end. You see very quickly she talks about how she actually helped them we hear her talking today about how she saved the family farm that’s what this story was about, and they knew when this woman got up to talk in the style that she was talking was telling a story about how she almost wen the wrong way but she ended up going the right way we hear that story frequently in church. 0529- Yes this is the full tape, we had to ftp it today we spent hours with it there may be some tech glitch in there we will receive the hard tape in the morning and we will upload again from that

            0002 to 0122- Parents who agree that they can identify with the Trayvon Martin Case and because they have their own unresolved cases if we know that we can bring those stories to the department of justice who will hopefully take the same action here that they have taken in New Orleans. Yes we have a terrible case here and we need to deal with that but we have a terrible pattern of and abuse and discrimination that we are going to deal with all together,  its hard people of all colors will see pictures of Trayvon Martin and not just see a kid who reminds us of some kid in the ghetto, its also about history of this community too many cases, you heard the person say last night you kill a dog you go to jail well a young man was killed and no one is in jail, now its handed over to the state’s attorney and be handled by a grand jury sometime next month frankly I cant imagine being a parent having my child killed having a police chief behave like this police chief, and be able ot keep my faith in them. 0301- see this is a tense situation but it is also a remarkably strong community, that has been able to live with this tension for a month, people now know that the DOJ is opening an investigation, people now know the date of when the grand jury will begin their deliberation, and so that gives people a reason to have faith and come to a close, they need to hold on for a month more, have faith. When you read that law it is hard to come to any conclusions, except the fact that Trayvon Martin had the right in this state to kill Mr. Zimmerman, and was following him and attacking him with a gun in him and threatening him and ultimately using legal force, what that law says if someone stalks you if someone attacks you if someone tries to kill you then you can respond with equal and opposite force everything we hear on that tape is this young man walking away, when someone is walking away from you and you hear the police telling Mr. Zimmerman to disengage you don’t need to follow him, and so our concerned here is that the department fears at every turn to take Mr. Zimmerman’s word- (cuts off mid sentence)

            0108 Interviewer- do you think the DNC is the reason Hillary Clinton Lost the election? 0112 to 0141- Jealous Well I guess what it says to me is that frankly all of us as Dems these days want to see our party stronger now that we’ve got to rebuild and frankly mist every building starts in our states in a weave we’ve lost ground states across the country and we’ve got to regain it, that means bringing in young people and that means more of us stepping up to run and so that why I’m doing that um yeah 0208 to 247- Jealous Look, I think its reasonable for somebody in her shoes to still be processing what happened I know many people in this country are, for the rest of us we’ve just got to get back to pushing forward frankly we have to be prepared to push forward no matter what’s coming out of Washington, what comes out of Washington these days you know is often just kind of bonkers, you know, and in the meantime we have children to raise, we have small businesses to build and we’ve got to get back just pushing out lives forward in our state’s other place to do that our cities our counties we really cant count on Congress right now or the Supreme court and we certainly cant count, you cant count on the White House. I mean, from day to day, it’s just a crazy story. 0301 to 0340- Jealous You know, look we have a bunch of great options and I think that Joe and Bernie are out there proving that your 70s are the new 60s, that’s hopeful for guys like me in our 40s, I don’t want to feel like we’re getting too old too fast so you know what am I going to say, anything about Joe this time, Joe’s a good man he’s wanted for a long time and if he wants to get out there that’s great and it means that folks will you know have a harder time saying that Bernie is too old so I think that’s a good thing. 0351 to 0533- Jealous So look my life has been grounded as a community organizer as a civil rights leader as somebody who spent their life living in communities working in communities with people on their own terms to figure out the big solutions to help move all of us forward and I’ve done that in my state. Again, I left the effort there to abolish the death penalty and I helped lead the efforts to pass marriage equality and to pass the DREAM act and touring across the state jus driving around in my truck with my kids sitting down with folks at their kitchen tables, what you heard you know again and again is we just want o move forward, in this you know the President’s tweets and all this craziness in Russia, you know what can we do right here and I see an opportunity in Maryland right now for us to move forward quickly on the economy on education and our kids need us to do just that so that’s why I’ve jumped in I guess the organizer in men the leader in me looks at what’s happening in Washington looks at how silent our governor is, you know, this Republican who on the one hand stood up and said no he was not going to vote for Donald Trump but now the Trump’s in office, he consistently has stayed silent as the Trump Administration slashes the Chesapeake Bay restoration plan, stayed silent you know or even worse, tours with Betsey DeVos and says that he’s going to shift money from our you know from our- shift money that should have gone to our public schools and use it instead to fund private vouchers I mean that’s not what the people of Maryland want, we want to get back to moving our state forward and that’s why I’ve decided to run for governor. 0628 to 0809- Jealous Well look just you know it reminds us of what so many black athletes have said over the years but here in Maryland it brings us right back to just a week and a half ago we had a young man just commissioned as a second lieutenant a US army student at Bowie State two days from graduation over celebrating with his friends at University of Maryland College Park stabbed to death by a white student at the University of Maryland who was part of a Facebook group called Alt Reich and appeared to be motivated by the hate, it’s the second incident like that in the last six months with a young white man from Maryland associated with hate groups stabbing a black man to death and the reality is that race in our county continues you now to be this lightening rod but for us as black men to just leave you know frankly having to fear too much and what we end up doing is just pushing forward but when you are raising children and you have nephews and you have sons, as I do, living with you at home um you know every now and then you just look at them and you say you know we’ve got to find a way to do better and that’s what we really need. Quite frankly is we need leaders who are prepared to pull us together across racial lines to have grown up conversations about race and to take the hate in our schools and with our young people seriously right now we’ve got a president who enflames that every day and that’s why we need more leaders in our country who are willing to step forward at least at the local and state level and try to turn things in the right direction again that’s one of the reasons why I’ve thrown my hat in the ring and decided to run for governor.

          <p>
            0028 to 0234- Jealous My name is Ben Jealous, I’m the former national president of the NAACP, I am running for governor because Maryland’s been good to my family and I want to make sure that our state is good to working families for generations to come. My family moved here almost eighty years ago from southern Virginia, granddad to work the B&O railroad, grandma to work for Planned Parenthood in 1941 they moved into the housing projects of West Baltimore and well a generation later they were at the Dulles Airport waving goodbye to me as I flew off to be a Rhodes Scholar thank you, my public school teachers are still wondering how that happened and what I’ll tell you is this- I can’t explain I mean we’ve lived that dream that Maryland dream that’s a littlie easier that the American dream is in other places because our states always been a little better but I cant explain it, without schools that were always strong and getting stronger, not weaker, and with great public education all the way through you know what made it possible to ultimately go from answering phones at planned parenthood or being a dishwasher on the railroad to being respectively a social worker and a probation officer, was that Maryland paid for their public higher education at a time before mass incarceration when our public hydration with out public higher education was free or almost free and so you can count on me as somebody whose family has benefitted immensely from our public school system all the way through to fight to make sure that we in these days where we under incest our educators and we under invest in our university students and we drive them into debt , we will end both of those when I am governor. 0254 to 0528– Jealous This struggle for me is personal, I have two kids in the public school  in our state and while my mom sued Western High School for girls in Baltimore when she was 12 so she could desegregate it in 1955 when she was 15 and what families who were involved in that but a gay should know is that our lawyers who ultimately guided by Thurgood Marshall understood that unless we were willing to also have funding equity we could never win and so I’m running for governor to finish what my mama helped a start and to make sure that our schools are well funded, that every school is a great school and that every child gets a great education and what does that mean that means that first of all we got to keep out promise on the casino money and the lottery money and we have to use that funding. See when you look at the so called racial achievement gap which is really if we’re on as part of a much bigger class based achievement gap what you will see in West Baltimore you’ll see in Cumberland, you’ll see in Salisbury its not always black and brown kids, there are a lot of poor white kids who are getting undereducated- is that the number one way to close that gap is to invest in having a great teacher  in every classroom, great educators in every school and if you’re going to have great educators in every school they you’ve got to be willing to pay a competitive wage and if you’re going to  do that then you have to have the courage on the budget to push first things first and yes if we’re under educating our schools by a sum of money that amounts to- sorry if we’re underfunding our schools by somewhat amounts to 5% of our overall budget that we have to figures out how to better manage our overall budget, to find that 5% because we are also going to need to make sure our kids grow up to kindergarten ready to learn that means a full day universal pre-k and ideally universal pre-k it means learning from other cities and other states and other countries where they’re investing in parent educators to help parents prepare young children, he’s investing in our home-based daycare providers but it also means having a different vision for how we educate for the trade so we’re preparing children to be career ready which maybe that you’re halfway through an apprenticeship to become a plumber. 0607 to 0641- Jealous We need to recognize that the underperformance of the American education system is fundamentally about our failure to support our low income children. Singapore leads the world in k-12 educational outcomes because the gap between their poor children and their rich children is four times smaller than it is in our country, if we’re going to push our country back to first it means we have to lift all of our children up. 0657 to 0711– Jealous My proudest accomplishment is having been the youngest NAACP president in the history and as the chronicle of philanthropy said on the front page when I stepped down Jealous leaves NAACP far stronger place. 0721 to 0747–Jealous Doug Wilder… you now if Virginia built a campaign of working families to break the color barrier at their state capital like 30 years ago I think maybe we should try to catch up. 0753 to 0845– Jealous I learned that those voters who voted Obama-Obama-Trump, who tended to be white and working class and those voters who voted Obama-Obama and didn’t vote tended to be black and brown and working class. Each felt betrayed on the economy. As Democrats, if we’re going to get back to winning we have to get back to being democrats and that means that we have to have the courage to stand up to Wall Street and to Big Pharma and say that yes we ate the party to advance civil rights and we are the party to expand economic opportunity but we are also the party, the party that will end poverty in our country. 0850 to 0900– Jealous The last book I read was ‘Young Men and Fire’ by Norman MacLean its about the first group of smoke jumpers who have an elite group of forest fire fighters. 0911- QUESTION If you could only pick one thing, what would you most like to reverse that governor Hogan has done in the last three years. 0915 to 1044 - Jealous Oh geez, you know if its one thing its him being governor and I got 53 more seconds left so let me tell you how were going to do that- I’ve been endorsed by SEIU and the Communication workers and the postal workers, the nurses, friends of the earth, Bill McKibben, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker- Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker. Think about that we’re going to build a movement of working families across the sate and we’re going to turnout Democrats by being Democrats on the only candidate Larry Hogan has made sure that the National Republican Governors Association attack pretty much weekly the last few months end its because he knows that we built a team to turnout voters and he’s only in office because voters didn’t turn out when I was president of the NAACP, Van Jones on CNN called the NAACP under my leadership the unsung hero’s of Obama’s reelection because we turned out 1.4 million voters, we will beat him doing just that and will wall up and turn unlikely voters thank you and god bless.

            0014 to 0133- Jealous We chose my cousin’s flower shop Baltimore Blossoms, it’s a great name we started just after the uprisings and it speaks to the yearnings and the front of the power of the people of Baltimore in people of our great state to move our state forward no matter what else is happening and that what we need to be doing right now you know, we’ve of course, have to resist Trump in his horrible policies but we also have to get ready to move beyond resistance to actually move our cities and our counties and our states forward no matter what’s happening in Washington and moving beyond resistance what does that look like to you means frankly seizing the power that we have know we as progressives for generations now have mourned the transfer of power from our federal government to our state governments but in this moment when extreme right-wingers control every branch of our federal government it is time for us to embrace what is and use the power in our states for good, to move out children’s opportunities forward to move our state forward out families make it possible to actually put a high quality teacher in every classroom where the whole police officers who have killed unarmed civilians accountable or to ensure that everybody here has access to health care. 0148 to 0231– Jealous You know, the reality is that everybody who’s working needs the same thing right you need a dependable schedule, you need a fair wage, and you need to know that when you’re sick you can take care of yourself. You need to have health care. Our governor had an opportunity to stand up for working people and he sat down instead … at least five days, I think most folks would say they need at least two weeks the reality is that you can’t get sick and your child can’t get sick and no worker should fear losing a job because they need to stay home to take care of a sick kid or frankly not you say able to take care of themselves so they don’t go to work and spread that virus to somebody else. 0243 to 0328– Jealous Right now, we have an opportunity to ensure that work pays again in our state that every parent an go to bed at night knowing that just working a 40-hour week is enough to cover the basement the basic necessities for their family the reality is that nobody wants a minimum job more, you want a minimum house or a minimum car um but we’ve got to set up floor somewhere and the reality is that the minimum wage had kept up with inflation it’d be at $15 it keep up with productivity it’d be at $19 seems to me like $15 is a reasonable place to start so lets go ahead and make that happen for working families across our state. 0354 to 0524– Jealous I’m a proud progressive whose entire career has been grounded in my years as a community organizer and as a civil rights leader I have  track record of standing up despite the odds despite the heat to do the right thing id that here when I led the state, built a movement here that succeeded in abolishing the death penalty did that again in the same year here when it was time to actually help pull in black leadership to pass marriage equality, did it again that same year when it was time to again pull in leadership across the state to pass the DREAM act and I’m sure I’ve gone to jail for protesting more than anybody else who’s running for governor across the country but the reality is that you know CAP is supposed to be a nonprofit organization so I’m not sure when my colleagues there if they felt betrayed felt betrayed arm by me standing up with Bernie, I’m a progressive and I stood up with a very proudly progressive candidate to push for the sorts of policies that we talked about, his CAP as fellows so you know its, um, this is all you can do was run it as yourself and fro my entire life on the children of organizers when I was 18 and I’m going to run like the proud progressive community organizer that I am. 0540 to 0706 –Jealous Leaders across the state right now are on a journey trying to figure out what is going on that we’ve had two young white men stabbed black men to death apparently just because of their race just in the past six months one from Towson and went up to New York City pulled out a sword and killed a black man, one in college park pulled out a long knife killed fellow student, took story of Cain and Abel, I commend all of those you have dug down deep and ask the question what more what more, what more can we do so loving a lot of good first steps we’re going to stay on that journey that inspires me most I was at his memorial at Bowie State, I was at his funeral, the resilience of his family and the commitment of his friends and his classmates at Bowie State and at College Park, young people coming together across lines of race and religion to say we’re going to move forward together, we’re going to create the world that’s destined to create a more inclusive vibrant productive place we’re not going to fall victim to the hate and that’s frankly where I put my hope. I put my hope with your generation, I put my hope with the young people rising up in this state for home frankly the history of division oppression matters less in shaping how they complete their own lives. 0724 to 0817- Jealous My grandma is a hundred years old. She started her career working for Planned Parenthood in Baltimore in 1940. My father has always been supportive and raised me to be the same way of a woman’s right to choose and to control her own destiny and to know as well as the struggle to ensure that everybody who need quality health care gets access to it, my parents its rights at the juncture of both of those movements, of both of those needs, we must as a state in this moment be prepared to provide quality affordable health care to everybody in Maryland no matter what happens in Washington, and I commend my colleagues frankly the Democrats at the State Capitol for the leadership they’ve shown on this issue. 0837 to 1034– Jealous I mean I’m a visiting professor so my power on the matter is limited I’ve been very supportive of my students both publicly and privately in their quest to get the name removed he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan and I um you know agree with folks who say you know generally like when buildings are named a long time ago we should respect the history there are exceptions for I mean how do you how do you heal with being at that school then on the same way I think that anybody I mean you know the reality with what college get out you go to I went to Bard College have you dug into the history of the northeastern liberal arts schools and where their money came from shit you know the reality is I went to Columbia University I’m a Rhodes Scholar, you look at Brown University it feels like its miles away from slavery yet it was funded by (interrupted by interviewer) I’m at the, my school teaching young people to today one of the few schools in the Ivy League where students are accumulating no debt and the reality is is that in our society the way that we change things is that we engage that we get involved that we add our voiced that we add our support and we keep pushing now when I was a student at Columbia, in getting a center to teach about the history of people of color in this country, to actually include us into the curriculum and ethnic studies department, we fought that fight for 25 years, if you give up and you walk away the great victories don’t happen so you know that’s how you change things is you dig in and you fight that’s what my life has been as an organizer and you know and that’s what we as progressives are when we’re at our best if you just sort of tuck tail and walk away nothing changes.

            0516- Thank you, I am proud to accept this on behalf of the NAACP, on behalf of our 1200 volunteer led active units across this nation and on behalf of our 64 person board who overwhelmingly voted to support marriage equality including our chairman Rossland Rock and out past chairman Julian Bond, I’m proud this evening to be joined by leaders on our national staff and the leader of the Maryland NAACP Gerald Stansberry, like his peers in Maine Minnesota and Washington State, Gerald is on the front line fighting for marriage equality every single day, Especially proud to be here with my night with my wife Leah tonight this is our first date since our son was born on the fourth of July. Sitting at our table is civil rights legends I say this man has a civil rights legend I say this man is a civil rights legend, let me make this clear, he was the organizer in Memphis leading the sanitation workers when Dr. King was killed. Bill Lucy, Bill Lucy who 30 years ago stood up at a tough and contentious Union convention and said that the fight for LGBT rights and the fight against racism were on of the same. In the more than four years I’ve been president of the NAACP, I have made it very clear that in order to have friends you got to be a friend, because as Dr. King once said to a teacher of mine if you’re comfortable in you coalition, your coalition is too small, our society must realize the promise that our school children recite back to us everyday when they say our great pledge, we must truly become one nation under God with liberty and justice for all that pledge is what we aspire to as an ideal but is not the lived experience of millions upon millions in this country and it must be, we owe it to our children for when they say that pledge is my 6 year old daughter does every day they don’t think that’s where they may live right now and I’m not going to disappoint her in order for us to become one nation all of the leaders in this room and we are all in one way leaders, all of us in this room, we must act as if we are one nation already so tis with pride that I ask you to join me and the rallying cry of the NAACP I think you’ve heard our president say this once or twice, fired up ready to go fired up far enough as a great American family, whether we were born here whether our family sacrificed everything to be here what binds us together is our commitment to persevere in the face of great odds not 22 not to just secure our individual families but that of our neighbors to as American parents, we believe nothing more fervently then that every generation must be better off and more open minded than the last as an American people we celebrate the many times that our nation has lead this world away from hate and ever towards hope and so in this precipitous moment when we as a movement or on the brink of massive change and tremendous progress when here we are, less than 50 years removed from when my parents own marriage was illegal in our home state of Maryland, when here we are finally at a place where we can be confident that the day will come, when marriage equality will be the law of the land in every single state let us stand up for marriage equality from coast to coast and border to border, let us stand together against racism as HRC did. When you joined us at the Stonewall Inn last March to declare our joint opposition to racial profiling in New York City and let us stick and let us keep on standing up together until this great country finally becomes as out school children pray for it to be every single day one nation under God with liberty and justice for all, thank you and God bless.

          <p>
            0018- Thank you, whenever I can walk out of Low Library and not be let out in handcuffs it’s a good day, it is quite an honor to be here with you, class on 2010, with your Dean’ and professors so many of New York’s finest, so I got to know well while I was here at college, as you step out of here today you will define your legacy and that of our country. These are days when we each are called to be clear about what we want not just from our lives but for this world these days of Dickensian contradiction walk into the department of justice and you will be greeted by photos of two men both graduates of this college, beneath their names you will see the words President and Attorney General, a few weeks ago if you walked into a field north of here in upstate New York you would have seen pictures of these same two men held above the heads of angry protesters with the words scrolled beneath their pictures saying Lynch Eric Holder, Lynch President Obama. These men, these women fantasize about taking us back to the 18th century and they distort what our founding fathers and mothers hoped for all of us lets party like its 1776 says Sara Palin as if the 18th century was good for any of us I mean sure rich white men could vote but their life expectancy was about 38 and in the wake that she and others leave as they crisscross across this country, the governor of Arizona has just penned a law that greatly empowers the ability of your local police department in Phoenix or Tucson to put you in jail if you don’t have your papers on you and they think you look or you sound like you might be foreign, I will leave here this afternoon and walk over to a press conference we will announce that we’re filing a lawsuit with the ACLU to invalidate that law and this Wednesday I’;; be in Texas where former secretary of education Rodney Page and I will be taking on the governor and his school board who want to change the way that the children across the south are taught to minimize what they learned about Thomas Jefferson, to minimize the very work of the word democracy to maximize the portrayal of the Confederacy and to defend Senator Joe McCarthy- I say to you class of 2010, lets party like its 2010, lets party like ours is the nation that brought the world the 21st century and yours is the generation that will define it and now is the time for you to declare that we will move this country ever forward and never backward now is the time 0429- for all of us who believe in the greatness of this country to stand up now is the time for all of us who would rather build this country up and out of this recession than tear it apart and leave it in, now this is the time for all of us who believe in hope not hate to speak up and be heard because change is what happens each and every day not just what happens on Election Day. If you’ve learned anything while at the college in this city you have learned how to listen to people who do not look like you, do not sound like you, did not grow up where you grew up, this is the most valuable thing you can carry out into this world the first time I left this campus I was involuntarily and blessed with some refunded financial aid dollars with loans bought a jeep and I headed down to Mississippi where the governor was seeking to shut down a historically black university, and turn it into a prison sort of like the school to a prison pipeline, no pipeline school, the prison, then we showed up just after Byron de la Beckwith who had been put in prison thirty years too late for having killed NAACP leader Medgar Evers and we announced that we would have a big protest to show the world at Mississippi that Mississippians did not believe in turning colleges into prisons. The Klan put out a press release I kid you not they apparently have a press secretary, the Klan put out a press release saying that they would kill one or all four leaders of the protest and I was one of those, and we decided that it was important that this protest not just  have black Mississippians and it also have white Mississippians because you can walk around to hear murmurs and know that there were lots of people who disagreed with the governor’s plan, but given the charge to find white liberals in Mississippi in 1994, we figured Earth’s day was the best place to look for him. And so we sent out teams of student organizers to all of the historically white campuses and sadly Mississippi, that’s the history, you only have white colleges and historically black colleges and by six o’clock all of them had been checked expect one, and by midnight I fell asleep at my desk. I know you all can’t recall this but there was a day before cell phones I fell asleep at my desk waiting for them to call in and at 2am the phone rang and they said that we’re okay but we had a bad situation of its state  0719- Mississippi State we need you to get down to the Waffle House right away, well like any you know college jock you couldn’t keep me away from Waffle House, so I hopped in my car and I ran down, there we huddled around the table and they explained that the students wouldn’t let them speak until the end did they mean the very end after it turned into a keg party in the third encore Sweet Home Alabama, it’s a great song, they were led up to speak and they chanted save the black colleges and the crowd roared back get a rope and here in the Pawnee woods in Mississippi north of Philadelphia where new  Yorkers Chaney and Goodman and Schwerner and Mississippian Chaney were ordered to their death by the local sheriff they ran to their cars and they did that little Mississippi two-step where you drive just fast enough to get the heck our of town and just slow enough that the sheriff wont notice you, and we were huddled around this table in this Waffle House and there was a man staring at us, an old white man who had gold rings on every finger and a baggy shirt in a state where for a hundred bucks and no felonies you could carry a firearm wherever you want to go and he kept staring at us real hard and we noticed in that instant that his shirt was baggy and a hunk below his pant line and we were the only black folks in the restaurant and it was 3 am at this point, we had ben there debating and discussing and he walked over to our table carrying two large bags and he looked at us real intently and said are you the boys I’ve been seeing on television now is from California by the way of New York and one guy was from Saint Louis another was from New Orleans and a third one was from Chicago, the four of us in other words were not accustomed to anybody calling us a boy who wasn’t our boy and let alone some old due at 3 o’clock in the morning, looked at us like he might want to kill us but we were the only black folks in the restaurant the Klan to put out a press release and we so we just looked at him and said yes sir, he said hold on a second, and he turned around to put down his to go order and his dominant hand was hidden and two of the organizers were football players and they were getting ready to jump him because they were convinced that he was going to swing around and shoot us and I said hold up lets just listen to what he has to say, and they gave me this look like then we might be dead by the time he says it, and I just said hold up hear what he has to say, and he spun around and extended his hand he said well I just want to shake your hand because if I’d been born an n-word in this crazy state I’d be mad as heck- I won the used car lot right down highway 49 explain the gold rings if you need anything if you need money if you need a car you just come and see me and know that I’m always on your side, the next morning I sent the organizers down there to get 100 bucks from him because I was getting paid 85 bucks a week and I needed to get paid and they needed their faith in humanity restored, because the day before we had made a critical mistake- we assumed that we knew who our allies were and we assumed that we knew our ally who our ally certainly wasn’t, and one got us a death threat to our face from an angry 1117- crows and the other got us an open hand from a man who we assumed to give us nothing but grief that is the courage that going to school in New York City teaches you that is the gift that you bring from here out into the world, in these times when we see the graduates of this college as heroes and angry mobs see them as boys to be lynched let us all be clear that we are the change this country needs you are the ones who will make sure that it happens and most importantly when faced with that moment of choice, always go with your gut it always pays off in the very end thank you and god bless

            0043 to 0156; Jealous- Bernie Sanders and I agree on a lot, we have an opportunity here to actually help the voters see that they agree with each other on a lot and to go get it done and that’s why I’m good you know that’s why I intend to be the next governor from the state, one of the mistakes that we make in this country is that we don’t talk about the ways that everybody suffer and so we’ll talk about the homicide rate for black men under 30 but we don’t talk about the suicide rate for men over 55, we’ll talk about the fact we have most economy black and brown people on the planet without mentioned, we also have the most incarcerated white people on the planet and what they all have in common is that about 90% couldn’t afford their own lawyer, Bernie and I have been organizers since we were young and the first thing that you’re taught is that you did not elect politicians to make change happen, no you meant you elect politicians to make it a little easier for you to make change happen for the people to make change happen for a movement to make change happen and what Ben Jealous is about has a radical idea that maybe government should represent all of the people and not just the 1%. 0209 to 0305 Jealous- I’ve made a dozen trips to the worst parts of the state already and what I find is that when folks listen and when I listen to them when we talk with each other we discovered that we have far more in common than we don’t, why was a backyard on the Eastern Shore in a rural area, the Trump voter asked me if I supported single payer and I said eyes and he said well then ill vote for you and ill organize other trump voters to vote for you and I said why and he said because I’m a finance manager at a car dealership and every year I’d read the same days, the say that we find out how much more than we expected our health insurance is going up again this year you say and then I have to have two conversations I hate to have one is with the owner of the dealership to explain to him that once again we’re going to revise down our profit projections because our health care they eat up more but then we expected and the other is with our employees we pause at whom I love to tell them once again when it comes to health care they’re going to pay more and get less. 0347 to 0430 Jealous- I’m running as Ben Jealous, I’m running as a guy who has been a civil rights organizers entire life, he’s run advocacy non profits to help folks make sure that their voices were heard and somebody who co-chaired Bernie sanders campaign here in the state, was one of his national surrogates and the reality is that the people of this state know that is my name on the ballot and they want to know who I am and I’m fortunate to have a long track record its very clear that I am somebody who fights for people who unites people across lines and who frankly only knows how to how to run one way, I got size fourteen feet, I cant be switching up positions you know I got it just got to run in one two correction and that direction is always towards the people trying to figure how we build real solutions. 0446 to 0506 Jealous- I have planted my size fourteen feet right here in the state that my family’s been rooted in for almost 8- years and I’m fighting to make sure the working families of the state get a better deal and we will surprise people and our ability to unite people across every line they say suppose to keep up apart, we’ll find that across those lines we’ll build bridges that will bring us all together.
