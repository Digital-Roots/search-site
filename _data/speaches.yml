  transcript: It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr. Benjamin Todd Jealous president. (Jealous)Well, good morning, no, it is, uh, thank you for that, for that.  Welcome and as somebody's parents met as teachers at Harlem park Junior High School in West Baltimore, it's good to be here.  It's good to be here, you know, and I'm here, as Ms. Johnson said, I'm here as somebody who cut their teeth doing the work that all of us do to make this country better.  Here's somebody who cut their teeth working for Front Lash out of the sub cell of 815 Sixteenth Street, organizing students and union members against NAFTA, and I'm here as somebody who was able to go to college because of his grandparents were union members, and what this life of being raised by people in the struggle to spend your life fighting for justice in this country has taught me is that if we're going to put this country back to work, we have got to pull this country back together.  I want it, I got a question for you. How many of y'all were in Washington on January 20th, 2009 for the inauguration of President Obama, January 21st, and how many of you watched on TV?  Y'all are the smart ones.  It was cold that day.  It was really cold.  You can tell who the Hollywood celebrities were because they had somebody to carry their Ugg boots at the party.  I realized that day, I was, I was sitting there with my NAACP skull cap pulled down over my head about 20 rows behind the president on the platform, watching this great change of power in this country, that I had actually been given the forecast two years earlier by my grandfather like so many other people who believed deeply and in the great cause of working for justice in this country, didn't quite make it to see that great day when the 233 year-old color barrier at the White House was broken, and I said to him in his final year of life, I said yeah Grandy, I think we got a winner, his name is Barack Hussein Obama.  Barack who?  I said, Barack Hussein Obama but me said let, he say he's black, right, and he said, let, 92 years of being a black man in America just help you out on this one, grandson.  It'll be a cold day, and he was exactly right.  We all know if you change the way the wind blows, you make it blow really, really hard, you can bring the temperature all the way down, and that's what that day was about.  People across this country celebrated, because after almost a decade of struggle in this country, we had come together.  We had changed the way that the wind blew, and we finally had it blowing in our direction, and that meant that the day after, while families woke up to a new day with the same old questions, we as organizers woke up and say well we got a lot of hard work to do, and we made a tactical decision where each of us ran out in different directions.  The Latino organization, the Latino groups ran out to pass comprehensive immigration reform. All of us that will support you but take the lead, and the teachers ran out to make sure that we had a stimulus bill, and to make sure that we're investing money in education.  The civil rights community ran out to take care of a whole long agenda that had been almost crushed by the Bush administration, and the faith community ran out to make sure that the poor and the least among us were taken care of as we dipped into a recession, and we've made a lot of progress that way, but in the past 18 months or so, we've also started to feel a little bit hollow, start to feel a little bit weary, start to feel a little bit alone and isolated, and our primary constituencies that we are active in, and on the horizon we start to see the massive backlash that always happens in this country when you make major progress.   We passed the Lilly Ledbetter bill.  They were shocked.  You passed a stimulus bill that allowed us to build up school infrastructure across this country.  We passed health care reform even after they said it was DOA, and each time we've made progress, this group on the horizon, this group of over privileged overeducated, I'm sorry to say that to teachers, but there is such a thing as over educated folks in this country, you know, there's a point when you have so much book sense, I can say this is a Rhodes scholar, but you have completely lost all common sense, but this group of over privileged folks are really part of a dying demographic in this country that call themselves the Tea Party has captivated the national imagination, and that majority that we all led together in 2008 seems to have forgotten that it exists, as if we've gone anywhere except for back to the couch, and our job together between now and November is to get them off the couch, to get our members back into the streets going door-to-door, making the case for justice in this country, reminding people how it is, that we have come to make such great progress in the last 18 months and of the own path, and the power that they own in their own hearts, if they just have faith that more, more progress can be made.  The way that you make the wind blow your way in Washington is you come back together and that's why Randy and I, the leadership of the AFT, the leadership of the NAACP, the leadership of the AFL-CIO, and the leadership of Service Employees Union, to last, the leadership of the civil rights community, the entire leadership conference on civil and human rights it's all 200 organizations and a broad faith-based group of allies are all coming together, called for a massive march on Washington on October 2nd, 2010.  You see in moments like this, you really only got two choices, and you look back at the history of the late 1960s or the history the 1950s 1930's 1870s, and what you see is that whether it's the depression of the 30s, whether it's sort of the end of the ascendant economy of the, of the 50s and 60s that when you get into tough times financially and you're making, still making great progress legislatively, that everybody in this country is called on to go in one of two directions.  Either you tear this country apart, you push it down hill towards division and hatred, or you pull this country together, and you do the hard work of pushing uphill towards hope and progress, and so as these group of folks who drink tea and apparently are very gainfully employed, according to all the polls, say that they're going to take this country back, I suggest we take them very seriously because they will take us right back to the 18th century if we let them, and my white dad would remind my black mama that the 18th century wasn't that good for anybody, because for even land owning white men like him, the life expectancy was about 40.  We have got to reacquaint these tea drinkers with volunteers who drink coffee and we have to do it with great urgency, because we are making progress every day towards getting this country's priorities back in order, but the inertia from the past eight years is so great and from the years of Reaganism and upside down economics for 30 years before that are so great that if we don't pull ourselves back together, push forward with all our might and make sure the economy of this country works for all of us, then all those voters that we registered in 2008, all those people we asked to take a leap of faith two years ago and really vote their best intentions, will become discouraged.  We will lose a generation.  I don't know about you but I'm, I'm tired of these periodic bouts of national insanity.   I'm tired of them telling us we don't have twenty three billion dollars to save teachers jobs but we do have 32 billion dollars for war. I'm tired of them telling us we got 32 billion dollars a war but we don't have money to extend unemployment insurance, and yeah, sure we know Congress is shutting down for the July fourth recess, but just let them eat hot dogs, and I'm tired of having weeks like the week I had a month ago where we filled a lawsuit against Arizona on Monday for making show me your papers the state motto.  Then we went down to beat up the Texas State Board of Education, who was having what can only be described as the Scopes Monkey Trial of social studies, and then having thought that we had rehashed the first half of the 20th century enough for one week, woke up to Rand paul wanting to debate the 1964 Civil Rights Act like it was a new idea.  Where are the people who can bring sanity back to this country, where are the people who can ensure this, this country stays on track towards hope and progress, but we have to come back to Washington on October 2nd together and demand the rest of the change that we voted for thank you and God bless I’ll see you in Washington on October 17th.

  transcript: (Host) We're joined in studio Justin Slagel justice legal co-host of the Justin Scott & Spiegel show / 98 rock their morning show.  We're joined the studio by Democratic candidate for governor, former president and CEO of the National NAACP, Ben Jealous and the reason Justin and it's, you know, kind of fortuitous that we have Ben Jealous joining us today.  He came in to talk about his ideas running for Governor to deal with the opioid crisis.  The Washington Post actually wrote the article on this but you come at a time, Ben Jealous, where we are suffering in the city.  We have had violence, unprecedented all of this year, but you come at a time when we have had a forty one-year-old beloved member of the Baltimore City communities that was shot and killed just a week ago, and this person was just leaving you know his job and Locust Point area, you're leaving a Royal Farms, shot and killed, and then we have the murder of 18 year police detective, detective Sean Souter, somebody who people have beloved person, not only in law enforcement but people in the community knew this person, shot and killed in an area, Ben this is how I want to start the conversation with you, in an area of the city at Freemount and Bennet Place over the last three years we have seen 11 shootings before the shooting of detective Souter, four homicides.  Ninety percent of what we're watching is opioid and heroin related so I want to begin there with you because this fight that you want to have for the state, of course, is a statewide issue but it really is dramatic here in the city of Baltimore feeding this violence, (Jealous) We have to get to a place where we're guided by what works, by common sense and by the humility to recognize that what we've tried in the past has failed us.  You can't incarcerate your way out of an addiction problem and yet at the same time, when you have officers on the front line who are seeking to make all of us safer, you got to give them every type of support you can the, that works.  Part of that frankly is to expand the Safe Streets program.  We got 200 neighborhoods in Baltimore.  We got 50 high poverty neighborhoods that also tend to have, be where the violence is concentrated.  We have safe streets in 4, in 4 neighborhoods, and we know that whatever neighborhood it is it brings down the shootings about 26% well  (Host)Let me reinforce that if I can Ben Jealous and I'm not sure how much Justin you're aware of the overall Safe Streets program, but in McElderry Park, we highlighted this the one safe streets program in East Baltimore for one solid year now, we've been experienced this spike in violence, for one solid year Ben Jealous there was zero, zero homicides in the McElderry Park and this program is why that happened I wanted people to know  (Jealous)That’s exactly right and so New York City has like doubled tripled quadrupled down they ran similar pilot programs and then they learned from them and they expanded them.  I've been to literally the largest and most violent housing projects in New York City.  They went 500 days without a shooting.  We can do the same thing here.  We've done the same thing here, as you know, we just gotta invest in what works and it upsets me I'll tell you because look, I've had two family members shot in Maryland in the last ten years.  One of them died, one of them survived and died not long after and when you're a murder victim family member what you know is that we need a, you know, we need to focus on the things that work and so you, you expand safe streets.  You deal with addiction, as you know, just with a recognition that poor addicts need what rich addicts need, they need rehab, not incarceration.  You recognize that we have a lot of addicts behind bars who are still getting their drugs. (Host) Easier behind bars then on the street (Jealous)And so you got to deal with the corruption that allows those drugs to get in there, but you also got to make sure that we have rehabilitation behind bars so they come back better, and then you have to figure out how do we actually rebuild trust between law enforcement and the neighborhoods they have, the neighbors they've sworn to respect and protect.  You know, our families, you know, go back to this same kind of cluster of neighborhoods in West Baltimore.  You know, my grandma used to watch, you know, watch your grandma's kids (Host) yes (Jealous) In the McCullough homes housing projects and my grandfather, what got him out of there was working as a probation officer, 30 years on the force here as a juvenile probation officer in West Baltimore and what, and what he would tell you is if we show courage today, which for him was often taking some of the youngest, sorry, some of the most violent young men in our city and inviting him into his living room to figure out how they get their lives straight.  We do better tomorrow (Host)But we had communities, Ben Jealous, here's my thing, we had communities then.  My grandmother lived on Cherry Hill Avenue, my grandfather, we lived in the areas where we were, where we were doing the public service work. you don't have communities anymore.  You have people, neighbors who don't even talk to each other who don't even know each other so we have this whole cauldron, Justin and, and Ben Jealous, of dysfunction that we're trying to bring what you elements (Jealous)and what we can control today we need to change and when it comes to the police officers, we got to get them out of their cars, walking the beats we got to recruit more from the actual neighborhood and we, frankly, have to be prepared to actually pay our best officers more so we don't lose them to Baltimore County because every time we get a great officer, Baltimore County comes knocking and, and, and, it's hard to say that officer, who's got to support his family, you stay in the city where there's a greater risk and we're going to pay you less (Host) As detective Souter shows us  (Jealous) And that's what makes his loss cut across, right. I mean you're seeing activists who primarily talk about police reform who are grieving over his loss (Host) They knew this man.  They knew him.  (Jealous)And he was a good officer.  He was committed to the, to the community.  He was a good dad, he was raising five kids, and the same people who are a threat to him are a threat to our families, to our cousins. (Host)Let me ask you, let's get back to policy for a second, because I agree with you.  We need to rapidly increase how we deal with opioid addiction arrests. (Jealous)Yes (Host) We need treatment on demand.  How do we pay for this, Ben Jealous, because at the end of the day, I've asked you on a couple different occasions, we need to fit within a budget, we’re not like the federal government, we have to fit within a forty three billion dollar budget.  How do we pay for this? (Jealous)We start by spending money better.  Incarceration is the least effective and most expensive way to deal with addiction.  I work in the social impact investment space where we fix tough social problems, frankly, through capitalism and, and we've created an idea we call social impact bonds in this movement.  The idea is that you spend money today on fixing a problem better, you save money tomorrow and so what we've said is we can, this crisis is as big as any public disaster we will face.  We have thousands of people dying every year.  The deaths from fentanyl are up 6x in the last 3 years.  Heroin has definitely (Host)It’s evened off, it’s kind of evened off a little bit (Jealous)Well, it's, it's up to 1,200 a year from like 200.  I mean that's not evening off we need to be bringing it down right, (Host) I mean what I understand is the fentanyl is really the issue. I mean, the fentanyl that we've seen is this synthetic opioid, is really the toxic element even more than heroin. (Jealous)Fentanyl, I know, it has recently surpassed heroin. (Host)Yes. (Jealous)Heroin was already high and has doubled.  They’re each over a thousand deaths a year in our state.  The other prescription opioids other than fentanyl are much lower but still very serious, and so we have to make sure that people get what they need when they need it.  the our lawmakers asked for 10 24-hour, 7 day a week crisis centers for people dealing with addiction across the state.  The governor gave them 1.  We need 10.  We need to make sure that in every corner of this state there are Rapid Response Teams if you have a loved one in crisis with addiction, you can call they can get to them and help for them to get to them that day. (Host)if you don't get to them that day they're using again. (Jealous)That’s exactly right in it or they die because they don't get, you know, the, the, the naloxone that they need.  Here in the city we've been forced to ration it.  This is a drug that saves lives, and we're rationing naloxone in Baltimore City going on six months now. So when you talk about how you pay for it, well, first we’ll spend money better.  Second, we will borrow a small amount of money, relatively speaking, from our rainy day fund, 10, 20 million dollars of a fund that's almost a billion  (Host)It's kind of pouring, it’s not raining, it's pouring right now (Jealous) No, that's exactly right.  This is what a rainy day fund’s for, with the intention of paying it back, A, by spending money better this is the whole social bond idea you spend a little bit today, you save a lot tomorrow, you pay it back.  The other, frankly, is that we need to be bringing more lawsuits against these drug companies for the crisis that they have helps spawn.  The reason that, that we've seen this dramatic increase in things like fentanyl that come out of a pharmaceutical laboratory or oxy, (Host)Mainly from China too (Jealous) you know, are that these are, you know, somebody created this product and they sold it and, and they're very comfortable, frankly, trafficking it in too many cases, and so we'll spend money better, we'll finance it internally and then we will also sue these companies and, and as we reap, quite frankly, the judgments and those lawsuits, or the rewards for spending money better, we'll pay ourselves back

  transcript: (Jensen) This is Brenan Jensen for the Chronicle.  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People turns 100 this year.  The group's new president, 36-year-old Benjamin Jealous is the youngest leader the storied civil rights charity has ever had.  He was formerly head of the Rosenberg foundation in San Francisco.  We sat down with Mr. Jealous to talk about his new role, the Obama presidency, his group's sizeable 64-member board and other topics.  Well, you've been on the job what five months? (Jealous) Yeah  (Jensen) If you had to point to one change you feel you've brought the organization as it enters the Ben Jealous era, what would you point to and say this is the? (Jealous) I think, let's say two changes.  One is that we're back in the black, I just can't repeat that enough.  We're here today, I'm at a staff retreat setting the framework in which we will begin designing and rolling out big campaigns, and in the meantime we've begun launching a retraining of our field operation across the country which will start in just a few weeks in uh basic community organizing skills.  (Jensen) I could be wrong but I believe you're perhaps the first president to have an extensive background in a nonprofit world.  How has that been beneficial to? (Jealous) In this, if you will, modern era of nonprofit management, post Sarbanes-Oxley, certainly is a real advantage to nonprofits being run by people who really understand the peculiarities and best practices and winning strategies of nonprofits.  I think that there's been, in this financial moment, there's some second guessing about the common wisdom of the 1990s, that the best world renowned nonprofits were run by people who had nothing to do with nonprofits, historically, and, so, I guess I do take some pride in being a seasoned non-profit manager (Jensen) Any thought that the board might be too large or? (Jealous) We’re a movement organization when you look at other movement organizations like Human Rights Campaign has 200 people on their board in total, ACLU is 83, the Urban League used to be at 64 and when they tried to cut as much as they could, they got to 44.  So, on that continuum, I feel like we're towards, towards the right end of it.  The bigger issue with a non-profit professional board is the same with the staff it's just, you know, it's about ongoing training and development.  We're starting right now with the staff, I know that there's interest from the Chairman in continuing with the board and that really, you know, the question is shouldn't be does the is a board too big but that does it work well. (Jensen) We have an African-American in the White House, probably something your grandparent's couldn't even imagine, how does that impact, you know, your work and your mission? (Jealous) In many ways, it increases people's hopes and with increased hopes come increased expectations.  We have a generation of young people right now who are batting a thousand because the only big fight that they ever permitted themselves to be involved in was this election and, quite frankly, this is a victory of a young generation of activists just as much as it's a victory of a culmination of the hard work of activists over decades. (Jensen) How do you to measure your success or progress?  Do you have any targets like X number of members or raise the profile or what sort of? (Jealous) We have, we have multiple goals, you know, and one of those goals was to, or has been to, get control the spin in the media. We have 25,000 media stories, only one person working the national communications job.  You can't say that you’re really controlling, you have an influence, you know, but in the in the vaguest sense, and that's been going very well, you know.  We have other goals as far as resources, you know, and that's been going up well we're up, you know, twenty percent over where, where we expected to be last year. (Jensen) Well, some critics like to question whether the NAACP is still relevant in the 21st century and you’ve outlined what the challenges are, how do you tell people that yes, this hundred-year-old group is the group that should be at the forefront? (Jealous) We are uniquely well positioned to build consensus in this country for those types of changes, the struggles of the last century were primarily around enforcing civil rights, right now the fight for good jobs, to fight for good schools, the fight to end mass incarceration.  Those are political battles, not legal battles; they’re not about enforcing civil rights as much as they're about realizing human rights. To go to the same school is a civil right, to go to a good school, or, if you will, the same good school is a human right.  One requires enforcing a social contract, one, the other, requires extending and amending the social contract, and that requires a plurality of voters, and you don't just need it on the coasts or in the blue states, you need it everywhere.  We're in 1200 communities across this country; we're concentrated in the red states.  Our people in their communities are insiders.  The NAACP in town after town is seen as an organization that has had a positive impact on that town and so that combination of reach, geographic spread, credibility you know and the ability to build coalitions and pull people together locally is a unique set of tools for a century when the job is to realize human rights and to expand the social contract.

  transcript: (Host) We’re joined by Ben Jealous, chair, he is head of the NAACP.  I saw folks from the NAACP at the Republican convention, now here at the Democratic convention.  Voter rights have been a clear message of the NAACP.  What do you mean, Ben? (Jealous) What we mean is that this country thinks that it should be one person one vote, that we should be able to vote free and fair, and we've seen more states pass more laws in the past year, pushing more voters out of the ballot box then at any point in the last hundred years.  Our country is moving in the wrong direction and, you know, it's not simply a Republican thing, as we've seen Rick Snyder, Republican governor of Michigan, veto strict photo ID.  We’ve seen Bob McDonald of Virginia actually expand the re-enfranchising of formerly incarcerated people and say, and say to his folks, don't even bring me a strict photo ID bill or I will veto it it's an extremist thing.   It's a far right thing, it's, you know, and it's, and it's having a real effect on this race, and, and, and it will have a real effect come November. (Host) Well talk about what's happening around the country. (Jealous) So Ground Zero right now is probably Pennsylvania, where this strict photo ID law, which says that you aren’t going to be able to vote unless you show up with a government issued ID with your photo on it and so forth.  It has not been struck down, so its been struck down in Texas and struck down, you know, in several other states, but it's still in effect there, and there's 800,000 voters in that state who don't have an up-to-date current ID, and black voters are hundreds, are 100% more likely than white voters in that state not to have their ID and there's just no way we're going to get all 800,000 of them IDs in the next two months. (Host) Why do people not have ids?  Explain, well, why there is a disparate impact on communities of color and poor people and older people. (Jealous) Right, so there's, there's a whole host of reasons, right, one is that this ID has to have the same address, and so if you're a poor person on the margin in this economy, is really struggling with three jobs you often move at least once a year and people just don't tend to go to the DMV once a year.  So, you could have an ID, it just might not have the right address.  If you’re too poor to own a car, and there are a lot of folks these days that are too poor to own a car, you tend not to have a driver's license.  If you're a student who moves, I mean, think about when you went to college, right, did you really run to the DMV to get a, you know, a driver's license from that state, no, most of us just carried the one from home, so there's a whole host of reasons and then, you know, it could also be because they say that your id needs to have an expiration date.  Well, if it's a veteran's benefit card there's no expiration date, right, because your status as a vet never expires.  Many student IDs don't have expiration dates and so they put all sorts of technical things in there, but here's the real funny part.  In court they admitted there's never been a case of voter impersonation in Pennsylvania. Bottom line is this, if the law is not intended to solve a problem, its intended to be a problem and that's what we're dealing with the Pennsylvania.  (Host) Explain the history of voting rights here.  We are in North Carolina, Charlotte, one of the first lunch counter sit-ins after Greensboro  (Jealous) Right  (Host) The Woolworth sit in.  Explain what the history of literacy tax, of poll tax. (Jealous) So the first thing folks have to understand is because they've heard of the 60s civil rights movement and the 50s, well those, those laws that Chaney Goodman and Schwerner that Medgar Evers and so many others were killed trying to invalidate were actually put in place 50 60 years before that, at the end of Reconstruction to, to really ensure white supremacy in politics in the south, and they put in place a whole raft of laws, the grandfather clause, which just basically, you were grandfathered in if you were registered to vote before the Civil War.  Tests on whether or not you can read, tests on, you know, a poll tax, right basically, saying that a man who couldn't pay the tax could be bought, and they also put in bans on formerly incarcerated people voting, but all of these had hugely disproportionate racial impact and they disenfranchised black voters, and they got rid of black representation in the South.  What we've seen is that every time that the vote has been significantly expanded for black people, there's been massive waves of voter suppression.  It happened after the Civil War and the enfranchising of blacks with the 15th amendment to the Constitution, it happened after the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, and here it comes again after we break the color barrier of the White House for the first time with the largest, most diverse presidential election ever.

  transcript: Konst Hey TYT this is Nomiki Konst, we are here in Washington DC right now.  We're about to have a conversation about Medicare-for-all.  This has been something that Bernie Sanders has been pushing for years and John Conyers as well, Congressman Conyers.  We've been talking about it consistently on TYT politics.  Well, it looks like there might be a state where Medicare for all is possible sooner rather than later, maybe before the nation goes Medicare for all.  We're lucky to have Ben Jealous, the former president of the NAACP, former Bernie surrogate and he is now a candidate for governor of Maryland, and Michael A Lighty, who is the policy director of NNU, the National Nurses Union, a great friend of ours as well, and we've had conversations about Medicare for all in the past.  So, um, I guess the first question is what comes first, Maryland or the nation? (045-145) JealousWell, you know, look, we think we know that Congress is not going to act, and it's certainly not gonna act in a good way, right.  Donald Trump there have been times when he's praised the idea of having a single-payer system but he's clearly in the hip pocket of Big Pharma and the GOP.  So in Maryland, we kind of dug in deep and we realized that we actually have much of what we need to go ahead and move forward.  The people of Maryland, as I’ve crisscrossed the state, have made it very clear that we need to make sure that everybody in our state has health care.  We need to make sure, quite frankly, that we get the cost under control that they stop surging.  This is a major source of poverty in our state.  I've talked to 80 year old women who are back in the workforce because they can't afford their pharmaceutical bills.  It's, it's choking our small businesses.  It’s the leading cause of personal bankruptcy and it's in the top five leading causes of untimely death in our state, so we've got to act.  We can't wait for Washington and, as it turns out as Michael can talk about in greater detail, we actually can move faster in Maryland than we can in probably any other state.  Konst What kind of system does Maryland have right now compared to the rest of the country.  Jealous Right now we have an all payer system, and what that means is that our hospitals, while they can charge different rates from each other, whatever they charge has to be the same for every insurance company, and that makes it much easier for us to think about a single-payer system because we know what the rate card is for each Hospital. It's much easier to plan.  (Michael Leigh Speaking 213-358) Konst So with that being said, makes sense, but there's the politics of this.  You are in a primary.  Your, the race, you know, the primary is not for another year, almost a year, and you've got to defeat the Democrats and become the Democratic nominee, and then you have to defeat the Republican governor.  How on earth is, is this possible, running on Medicare for all, possible and then once you are governor, how are you be able to move that through the legislature. (428-630) Jealous We’re blessed in this campaign to be building a big tent of support. We start off with Bernie's endorsement, you know. We'll be rolling out six major unions, and frankly, some folks who supported some, some major endorsements, some people who supported Secretary Clinton as well, in fact, Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, has been helping us raise out there and, and recently endorsed and so we've sent a signal that we're gonna do in this election what I've done in Maryland as an organizer for years. I was named Marylander of the year in 2013 because I was president the NAACP. In one year, I led the effort to abolish the death penalty, first state south of the Mason-Dixon to do so, and we won. I co-chaired the effort to pass the DREAM Act, first state south of the Mason-Dixon, and we won, and we also put organizers on the ground from the NAACP in Baltimore City and Prince George's County to help deliver the vote for marriage equality. All three of those battles at different points, we were told were impossible to win. We got them all done in one year by organizing. We have a big advantage in our state. You know, 2018 Maryland is, will be the easiest state for us as Democrats to take back from Republicans. Now, that's not, that doesn't mean that it's gonna be easy, but it will be easier than any other state because Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one in Maryland. Our party is very strong. 2014, we didn't turn out and the Republicans surged, but my campaign, my campaign manager is a guy who turned out 125,000 more voters in 2010. He ran the effort for the party he was the ED of the party and for me, former president NAACP, one thing I know how to do is to turnout unlikely voters.  In 2012, Van Jones on CNN called us the unsung heroes of Obama's re-election because we turned out 1.3 million voters, so we're building a movement of working families across the state. This issue is central, and we're confident that we can win this, just like we won all those other battles. Konst Medicare for all is polling very high, so it seems like it's a go-to for Democrats if you want to win elections across the country, you campaign on this, but you're the only Democrat right now in your race who is, is number one, endorsed by NNU but for Medicare for all is that that's correct? (648-722) Jealous My conviction in this race is that if Democrats run as as Democrats, we win.  We're the party of FDR and RFK and MLK and Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Mikulski here in Maryland. What all those folks have in common is they were on fire both about advancing civil rights and ending poverty and expanding opportunity for everybody and if we run in that tradition, there's no way that we can lose. It inspires people, it gives them hope because they know that we're going to turn around and fix real problems in their lives and this is a huge one. Konst You touched on this a bit and, and maybe you can answer this in more specifics, what if we passed Medicare for all in Maryland if we're not fighting to protect chip programs, where children, you know, suddenly don't have access to health care, what, like, what are the numbers? How many people will be covered? What are, let's get into the nitty-gritty here so, so folks who support this and want to go and convince the Republican family members who are for it, but don't see it as is good for the economy, don't see it doable, don't see it popular, like what are some numbers on that, that would, you know, that would play out if we pass Medicare for all. (Leigh speaking) (1055-1519) Jealous As you travel across the state, what you see is that there's real pain. Out in Western Maryland, right when I started my exploratory committee, thousand working-class folks, mostly white, show up six o'clock in the morning, fill up an amphitheater waiting for free dental care, you know. Then you, you know, travel some further up in Western Maryland, folks saying in their rural county, it's half their economy. If Obamacare gets killed, their economy will implode. The health care workers, doctors, specialists, all around a rural hospital that without Obamacare would implode. The flip side is, if we cover everybody then their economy grows. You know, then you come down to Montgomery County, the wealthiest County in the state.  I'm at a union rally and a white-collar professional who was actually with us on Bernie, walks up to me and he's bawling after this Union rally and I said, you know, please, like, compose yourself.  I give him a big hug, I wanna understand what you're saying. He composes himself and says Ben you said in there that when you were young, you suffered from a juvenile seizure disorder, I said that's right, and you said that your parents worried you would die at different points when you were a young child, when you were a young adult, because you didn't have health coverage, you know, you couldn't get the  care that you needed. I said that's right, he said, well, five days ago my girlfriend, a 52 year-old psychologist, world-renowned in her field who had hit a gap where she didn't have health care coverage, died of an epileptic seizure in her sleep because she could not afford health care coverage and apparently she had not shared it with folks, she was kind of carrying that shame to herself. The irony is her father's a doctor in upstate New York, and he had, and my friend had just had a conversation with his recently deceased girlfriend's father, he said looking at the death certificate, yeah that's right, that's why she died, asphyxiation from an epileptic seizure, but let's be honest she's not with us because she couldn't afford health care. And then you go out to Western Maryland, I was sitting in the back yard, standing in the back yard at the end of a presentation with 100 people who had gathered to support my campaign, and the kind of one real skeptic in the room was a guy who'd voted for Donald Trump, and he asked me where I was on Medicare for all, health care for all, and I said I was all-in.  He said, well, what are you gonna do if Trump won't support it, and I said we'll get it done here in Maryland. He says really? I said absolutely. He said then I'll vote for you and I'll organize other folks who voted for Donald Trump too, and I said okay, I got a question for you which I said why? You know, scouting headline like Trump supporter supporting former NAACP president for governor. He said look, he said, for me and for my friends, he said, we all work for small businesses.  He said I'm a finance manager in a car dealership and my bottom line is really simple; it's my people and it's my business.  Every year, I fear the same day, and it comes like clockwork every year. It's the year we, it's the day we find out the health care costs are again going up way more than we expected.In Maryland, we're talking they're up 55 percent just since the governor's come into office. They're going up to 33 percent again this year.  He said, and then I have two conversations I'd hate to have. One is with the owner, to explain to him that once again we're gonna ratchet down everything; bonuses, profit projections, all of it. Then he got all choked up, he said it's what the employees, whom I love, to explain to them once again when it comes to their health care, they will be paying more and their families will be will be getting less. He said my bottom line is my business and my people, neither gets stronger, neither gets healthier until we take the profit motive out of basic health care coverage. So, I'm a free market guy, if you want additional types of insurance, that's fine, but he said, you know, I've got a right to run a strong business and we can't do it under this current regime.  And the reality is the numbers behind that. America 5% of the world's people 60% of big pharma’s profits. Medicare, the overhead 3%. Private insurance 17%. You know, we, we have massive bureaucracies right now telling people what type of care they can get.  They're working for HMOs, they're not working for the government but they're working for HMOs.  We can do much better if we go ahead and pass this. We've got the will, it's across the spectrum in the state. We're gonna build the movement and we're going to get it done.  Konst So why is it that you're not seeing more small businesses come out? Why isn't the Chamber of Commerce in support of Medicare for all if it would alleviate this, this frustration so many small business owners have with healthcare costs? (1537-1759) Jealous Small-town Chamber members, no doubt, just like the guy I'm talking about.  The actual chamber itself represents corporations, really funny politics, lots of pharmaceutical companies paying their, their dues, but when you get down to like the local small town Chamber members, folks who belong to the Lions Club and the the Kiwanis, you can have a real, a real conversation, and all that they really want to know is can you get me a better deal, will it cost less or at least will it be more stable and you know will our folks be covered?  I spent six months last year trying to move a factory from Edmonton Canada to Baltimore. We were gonna put it on a block the rest of that block is pretty much just public housing projects, and there was a vacant sort of brown field that that we were gonna put a vertical farming operation, farm lettuce on top of shipping containers so it was a way to use this space that otherwise was pretty poisoned, and this Canadian entrepreneur, born in the US but spent his adult life in Canada, wanted to come back home, is having a family wants to build a family here, convinced that America has a more competitive economy, and then we started to look at the cost of taxes and they were about the same but then he realized taxes there include health care.  In here, it doesn't. He was willing to stretch a little bit to get back to the states and then he asked me the one question, which is, is this a stable cost scenario.  Is it gonna change suddenly?  I said honestly, health care usually does. Sure enough, you know, a few months later, here it is surging thirty three percent again. I said he said you know what, I can accept all of this cost structure but I can't handle the uncertainty. So now he's talking about moving his factory, trying to get closer to the US market. He'll move itfrom Edmonton to Montreal, but he's notgonna cross the border. He's not gonnacome to Baltimore.   Those folks in that public housing project aren't gonna be able to apply for those jobs, which frankly we were putting it there because we knew there were many folks who would qualify on day one, basically because our health care costs are so unstable.  That's part of what drives me.  As you know, I spend my every day  investing in small businesses, growing them into big businesses, you know ,that's what I do as a social impact investor in Maryland, and it was just outrageous to me that after all that work, we couldn't get the factoryhere, even though the employer was willing to accept higher costs. It was the uncertainty and the fact that health care costs surged so often that kept him from coming here (Lighty speaks) Jealous And one of the other things you can do, frankly, is unleash a lot of talent.  We have a lot of young people who should be in the startup business, growing the next great company, but they're staying in a dead-end job because they're afraid to lose their health care. You know, we have single parents who want to go back and get education, but their health insurance is tied to their job, so they stay there to provide coverage for their family, and quite frankly that hurts me because what got my family, my, my mom and my grandparents out of public housing in Baltimore and moving towards being able to provide a better life with that for the next generation, for my generation, was that the state of Maryland paid for them to get their public higher education, and they were in a place because there were two parents in the household, where one could provide health coverage for the other as they went through school, but now frankly with so many more single parents, as I'm a single parent, the reality is that you have a lot of folks who are, who cannot better themselves, cannot better their families, cannot provide better for their kids, simply because if they leave that job even if they can pencil out everything else they won't be able to assure everyone has healthcare (Lighty speaks) Jealous Frankly freedom and lost productivity because that freedom leads, in our Country, where we lead the world in innovation and a job creation, this is something that holds both back, and we need to unleash both.  So really, to have jobs and freedom, we got to have Medicare for all. Konst …you have you have a good how many months until your primary? Jealous It is June 26 to 2018 and we're rolling out endorsements steadily great piece just written by Bill McKibben.  Friends of the Earth has endorsed and several unions, starting with the nurses, the postal workers and we have several more coming soon

  transcript: Jealous Place where Bernie would call for the police to stop killing unarmed black men and women and I knew how, how loud those tears were here in Chicago, all we’d gone through and if there were any more tepid in the Ozarks when all of us were in a dead sprint across this country, trying to make sure Bernie won. I knew I would be a little off and which you can't afford, to be sure, I was getting anxious and then Bernie made the call and the cheers were just as loud in the Ozarks to stop the killing of unarmed civilians by the police as they were in Chicago, as they were Detroit.  In fact, they were so loud and so sustained, John, I poked my head through the window, curtain and I walked up to the left where all those guys, they must have been in the hunting club, in there deer hunting camouflage were clustered and half of them were standing on their chairs with their fists in the air, and I really didn't know what to make of it. I knew there were white men who stood for racial justice, but, you know, that cost my father his inheritance and I didn't think I would find a critical mass in the Ozarks ever, but there they were.  Bernie gets off stage he's running back to get a drink of water. I grabbed his sleeve, I said Senator, he says Ben, I said did you hear that?,  he said hear what?, I said the applause line, Senator, they were exactly the same as they were in Detroit and Chicago, even when you called for the police to stop killing unarmed black men and women, and he said Ben, I'm glad you stayed to hear that, that's the revolution in this revolution, and that's why each of us is called to be but here's the other thing, and I want you to pay attention to this because, you know, groups like Priorities USA are spending a bunch of money polling to try to figure out the obvious. I sat there thinking what just happened?  How did that happen? You know, the Democratic Party is good at this thing called identity politics, but we don't do it with everybody because, you know, women, they tell you, we'll go talk about the ERA even though it's the 40th year in a row and we still ain't got a plan, right, and Latinos will say, we'll go talk about comprehensive immigration reform and black folks maybe it's ending mass incarceration or it's bringing jobs back to the inner city, but though, when it gets to working-class white men, we haven't had much to say for like 25 or 30 years as we brought Wall Street into our party, but here's the funny thing.   The only thing they want to hear about is restructuring the economy, making it possible for us to all have access to the American Dream again.  Health care for all, ensuring that the minimum wage actually catches up with inflation, making it easier to organize, making things in this country again a pathway to prosperity, ensuring that all of our kids can afford to go to college without going into debt, and Bernie had done that for half an hour and just like any other group and the, on the left in the Democratic family, if you spend half an hour talking to folks about their needs and how you're going to address them, well, guess what, when you ask them to be an ally to somebody else, they're ready to do it.  Now, here's the rub as president of the NAACP, you know, I mobilized in 2012 our organization, we were credited with turning out 1.2 million unlikely voters in the black community.  The unlikely voters are always the poorest voters in our cities, in our community.  When I went home to West Baltimore from the Ozarks, the voters in the neighborhood, my own family members who are reluctant to vote sometimes, they were waiting for the same conversation that the brothers in the Ozarks were waiting for, they were waiting to be told how are we going to fix these problems?  How are we going to bring jobs back?  How are we going to make he thinks again?  How are we going to make it possible for our kids to go to school?  We do that and we will win.  That's what Christine did.  That's what Carlos did, that's why Roe was able to go to very progressive district and take out an incumbent.  That's why this nurse will be in Congress. (Moderator) Brother, that was so good. You are running for governor of Maryland.  We are running up against our time limits here, but I do want people to know, I want you to do one thing for me, will you?  Alright, alright you think you can do that in Maryland ? Jealous Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah, yeah, lets be clear. There’s Bill who’s running, there’s Danielle who’s running, but let’s be really clear.  In Maryland, Bernie won 36 percent of the vote.  This will be a three to eight way race.  All I gotta do to get to forty ,all I have to do is get to forty and we've won the primary.  Now, let's talk about the, our Republican governor of a state that's two-to-one Democrats to Republicans won in a year when there was the highest tide of Republican turnout we had ever seen and the lowest tide of Democratic turnout we can remember.  He won by sixty thousand votes in a year when 125,000 Democrats who had voted in 2010 did not show up in 2014.  We give folks a reason to turnout, we do what we do best and we organize and there's no way that in 2019 Maryland has a Republican governor, but here's the other part brothers and sisters. I'm an organizer. I've always been a community organizer.  I’m the son of organizers.  We do not, this is not about me becoming governor.  This is about making it possible for our families and our movements, the women's rights movement, the civil rights movement, the labor movement, the LGBT equality movement, all of our movements being able to govern, being able to have faith that our government reflects our interests, moves our families forward.  This is not me, this is us.  This is us.

  transcript: (Sway (host)) On shade 45 Denise in Las Vegas are you there Denise? (Denise (caller))I'm here  (Sway) Go ahead  (Jealous) Welcome  (Denise) I’m just disgusted that so many people are calling, saying that this is okay.  I just can't believe it.  I remember I got pulled over in junior high, well not pulled over, but we got stopped after, after a bus fight and it was like, I'm taking down police officers names, I'm home and I'm outraged, and so I can't imagine this happening to people on a frequent basis and people don't see that this could be detrimental to them as a person. (Jealous) We have eight year olds in this city who tease each other because they're stop, because one is a stop-and-frisk virgin because that, because the other eight year old hasn't been stopped by the cops yet.  We cannot raise a generation of kids to expect that they're going to get frisked when they’re children because then I turn around they’re expecting it for their children and we're going to be living like this forever.  Folks have to stand up and say enough is enough.  If my kid’s innocent, treat him like he's innocent.  If my kid’s a criminal, treat them fairly but treat him like he's a criminal, and so yeah, no, I mean, you know, this is, this is outrageous and it's heartbreaking to hear the mothers stand up and talk about their strong, proud, 18 year old sons curling in the fetal position on the couch and crying, saying why the cops do that to me? I didn't do anything wrong, and when we have this much contact with the cops and you increase the likelihood that the young girl will get sexually assaulted, a young boy will be killed or beaten, um, you know, there's a lot of bad things that can happen when you got, when you have more stop and frisks for young black men and boys then there are young black men and boys in the entire city (Sway) Okay, President Obama on NAACP you guys work closely with the president?  (Jealous) Yes. (Sway) All right, how do you think how would you rate the job he's done as president up until this point? (Jealous) You know, as the first black president, walking in to two wars, a recession and a resurgent far right-wing populist movement that has called him everything but a child cot, you know.  I think the man's done pretty well just, just, just to keep it together, okay, um, he has done a great job for a man who's had to deal most the time with a congress that wouldn't do anything.  Um, he could have done a much better job if Congress was willing to actually, because Congress makes the laws and they actually appropriate the money and what we need right now is jobs investment, and Congress has held them over a barrel every time.  They let him get a little bit of money out to create jobs, and for the last two years said that's it, we're not creating any more jobs.  The problem is that, that is the playbook from the Great Depression that turned our country around and when you say to the president, we're not going to let you use the one playbook that the country knows works, that's where our anger should be right now. (Sway) All right Nicky you have a question right? (Nicky (co-host))I do have a question, since you brought up President Obama, many people say that he hasn't done enough for the black community and I know as the President he is the President of the United States of America, so, all citizens of color, but what do you say to those people who bring up that argument that he hasn't done much for the black community.  What should he be doing for the black…? (Jealous)Sure, you know the, the, this president has rebuilt the, for instance, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.  Why is that important, because we have southern states that are literally passing the first poll taxes.  We got rid of the poll taxes to hell strict voter ID requires you actually pay to get an ID before you can vote.  It will exclude in places, in some places, three-quarters of the young black men.  That said, you don't have an up-to-date valid ID, and voting is a right, so, it's not a privilege, so it's his DOJ that's going after it. George Bush's DOJ actually promoted that type of policy, they wouldn't have gone after that.  We had an increase in hate crimes, they are going after hate crimes.  They're also are taking on notoriously corrupt police departments like the one in New Orleans, again, something that Bush’s DOJ wouldn’t have done, so there's a lot of good civil rights work happening.  The president is the reason that GM is still in business.  Mitt Romney, you know, was, was very clear back then.  I'll, you know, I don’t want to get involved in campaigns, we’re a non partisan group, but, but there are a lot of folks at the time who were saying just let them die, and there's a lot of black folks who are employed by GM.  If you're in Detroit, it’s one of the few places where black men can still go to get a decent job.  So he has been very courageous he's meant but he, you cannot underestimate what he's been dealing with in Congress.  We had four hundred bills good bills passed in the, in the House when the Democrats were in control that couldn't get through the Senate because in the Senate, you need a super majority to pass anything.  The Republicans have filibustered everything, and so that's what we're dealing with right now.  So, yes, I think that the president could have done more if Congress would have worked with him.  I think that the President will do more, you know.  We have pushed him to be more explicit on the issues of racial discrimination and, at the same time, he has done more than any President in recent memory to actually fight racial discrimination.  Recently, Pepsi was, uh, just fined three million dollars.  They were using formerly incarcerated status to basically lock black men out of employment, and so there have been a lot.  He has really taken on two wars, taking on this recession and also rebuilding the entire civil rights apparatus inside of our government.  There's a lot of folks who have benefited from that in ways that they won't even understand for a few years.  When they look back in and realize that but for Holder protecting their voting rights and turning around their police department, they would be living in a very different place.

  transcript: (000-300)(Jealous) I asked on the way down here when was the last time we asked our national president and CEO to travel to a state board of education and no one could recall.  You are an important group. You have an important task.  Forty percent of the states in this country buy textbooks that are guided by you here. I'm here to represent the 221 branches of the NAACP in Texas, as well as the hundreds more in those forty percent of all other states.  I have received emails from people in states throughout the South and Southwest very concerned about what you're doing here.  They're concerned about the process, they’re concerned about the apparent disregard for your own advisory groups, from official advisory groups, they're concerned about the impact on the children, their abilities of the children to understand this country, how we have come to be as great as we are.  They are concerned about the ability of the children to compete on future national exams, having learned a view of history that is tailored in the ways that have been proposed. In summary, we are concerned about quality, not quotas.  We are concerned about the whole truth.  We want our kids to learn the whole truth not half of it.  Texas, the students, the students in those forty percent of all states that are going to learn to from these books must compete for college seats and jobs with students from all states, and from all countries these days, and they must arrive equipped to college or to take the SATs with a full understanding of our nation's history.  These teaks threaten to hurt their ability to compete on the AP tests, for instance. We also know from our work, from the struggle for civil rights and it’s important to understand that it was a struggle; it wasn't just divine inspiration as one of our faith leaders suggested earlier.  We have learned that it’s important that they learn about the struggles of all people in this country.  We take great pride, for instance, someone was talking about the Irish, that the Catholics were the group that benefitted second most from our drive to end the scourge of lynch mob in this country.  So in closing, I would ask that you just take a moment to slow down.  You've delayed once before.  If you respect your advisory boards, the people in this room, the people the stakes we're now talking about not buying these books because they're so concerned about the process, president elect, their process.(School Board Moderator) Thank you Mr. Jealous. Are there any questions? Mr. Bradley. (305-333) (Mr. Bradley) I appreciate you being here.  In your statement you received a lot of communication from folks of the concern about the ability of the children to perform on the international exams. Are you aware that Texas is one of two out of all the states that rejected to participate in national standards and national exams? (Jealous) We're talking about the AP and the SAT, and your kids will take that. (Bradley) Do you support Texas’ individual right as a state to have this discussion here in Texas or should we just go ahead and abdicate this responsibility and kick in on up to Washington and adopt the national standards. (356-411) (Jealous) We’re a, we think it’s very important for this conversation to happen here in Texas. I think it's also important that you understand that people in states across this country are very concerned because what you do here will impact their children. (Moderator) Mr Allen (Allen) I want to thank your for coming today and thank your organization for it’s over 100 years of service to our country, I believe it is 101 years this year, so that’s phenomenal.  What I'm asking is because I see coming from a national position so it appeared to me that you were speaking as though people were fearful so what are some of the things you’re hearing people say that impact what they're doing in their state if what we are doing here is so fearful? (450-520) (Jealous) Sure, taking the word slavery out of the description of the slave trade, taking out reference to the Declaration of causes in the explanation of why Texas seceded from the Union, and so forth. We would be happy if you can slow this down, we would be happy to have our state leaders actually to sit down and go through line by line, um but those sorts of things concern people very much they want to make sure that the kids know the whole truth.  (Moderator) Ms. Leo  (Leo) Well I'm sorry that you’re just getting involved in, that you're late in the process because we’ve been doing this for two years, but I want to know where slavery was taken out and what your source of information is. (539-602) (Jealous) Sure, we're talking about the teak, the change that refers to the title of the trade, now calling it the triangle trade and our, and our branches, we can, we can get that for you I didn’t come up here with a chapter and verse.  I would be happy to talk after, that's the heart of what we are asking for.  Our 221 branches have been engaged in the beginning as is our state conference president Gary blood so they only call in the folks from the national when things get completely out of hand. (Leo) Okay well I'm just asking you because we need specifics if you’re going to come here and ask for specific changes. (Jealous) We’re asking for the time to have that conversation (Leo) Have you read standards?  Jealous Yes I have a national and so has our national (Leo) Okay and which teaks are missing?  Why do you feel that our students will not be able to pass SAT exams or AP tests, on what basis do you make that claim? I want specific standards that are not in here that you would like added so that our students may be able to pass these because you’re making these allegations that they will not be able to. I want to know which basis, how, what they, what are you basing that? (Jealous) Ma’am, with all due respect, pass is a very low bar.  We want your kids to be able to do the best. (Leo) Correct so can you give me any specific teaks that you would like added? (Jealous) We would be happy to, we would be happy to, (Leo) But you don't have those today  (Jealous) No ma'am, you know, I've read the entire Bible but I can't quote chapter in verse I’ve read all of this and I even endeavored to read the entire health care bill but what I've learned from my years is that it's best off to sit down, slow down, and have a conversation. We will walk through line by line.  (Leo) We have been doing that for two years (Moderator) Are there any further questions? Mr. Agosto. (Agosto) Mr. Jealous, thank you I just have some quick questions.  Would you say the stance of the NAACP is that these cables don’t represent, as far as your organization, the academic standards, and they will be acceptable in our process as far as as far as it concerns the NAACP. (746-825) (Jealous) Yes that's right and I think I speak for the entire of civil rights national leadership when I say that. I sat down with others with Janet McMurky and with Nina Perales. You know, all of us are Americans and we're concerned about the lack of description about the struggle that happens in this country to actually get us to where we are, telling of the civil rights history as it relates to cases brought on behalf of Latino children.  Our children need to understand when our country makes a mistake, what it takes to actually make the change to overcome that.  (Agosto) Do your raise the importance of knowing about the struggle in history, do you believe children should know about the fight of civil rights, I see you had mentioned, I read a paper in there, you know, there’s no mention of secession, and think maybe we tap on the iceberg with what the ideology and the fighting and the struggle, and we understand that of our children understand what we went through, what people went through for civil rights and even the NAACP. Do you find that important? (Jealous) Yes, yes, absolutely. We, you know, our country is a great country.  It's a great country because we as the people of this country have always fought to, over to, and struggled to overcome its greatest obstacles that the different groups have put in our way, and the civil rights struggle needs to be understood in its complexity. Kids cannot be taught, as was advocated up here earlier, that people just read principles and it suddenly changed. That’s not the way it works. That's not the way that, dare I say, it, a democratic society works. Thank you. (Moderator) Mr. Mercer (Mercer) Thank you for being here.  My question is, you’re talking about the SAT and ACT, ACT covers science, math, reading, and English and the SAT has verbal math (Jealous) and the verbal includes comprehension and large written sections, and if the facts in there don't comport with what the kids here are taught, if a kids trying to catch up with history in there because his textbook omitted the hard facts, this time the easy facts, then you are creating distraction for the student on the exam.  It has also been shown that when you cut out the telling of the history of entire peoples, or you minimize it and you select from it, but you don't talk about the struggle then kids are not inspired to achieve in the first place, that they lose interest in school and they don't even get there for that test. (Mercer) Do you support that this board voted again to celebrate freedom week k to 12 and as grade appropriate we have the kids understand the relationship between the declaration of independence written by Thomas Jefferson, the declaration of independence and its relationship and impact with documents like the Constitution, the Bill of Rights the Emancipation Proclamation that we discuss those ideas as we have them in our standards right now (Jealous) I think that discussing them is great and I hope that that's not confined to a week or a month as people often try to do with black history.  We're talking about the full school year. (Allen) I just want to ask you a question I don’t want to put you on the spot but as you represent the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People I find that, and I think you would agree with me, we try to be politically correct.  Sometimes when we sit here and we hear something like you've got mold in your hair. I don't think we recognize the pain in that statement Martin Luther King gave a speech called “all here and now” we want our history in its totality, all of it.  We want it right here in the state of Texas, and we want it done now.  You can't give me two more their kids two more 10 years from now and two more after that to say we finally have made it where we need to go.  I think that's what, I don't know, wasn't.  I don't like to be insulted and from your positions would you believe that that's the kind of language we should be using now that we got you in two spots but we only had you in one last year. (1220-1320) (Jealous) I think that that's the case.  I really do you want to move us beyond quotas get into quality. It's not about what is pc and what is factually correct. I'm concerned about the, if you will I was a fan of F Troop as a kid and I'm concerned about the F Troop-ification of our history. when you don't mention a man like Hank Cardinal at the Alamo, you know, then you go back to, you know, at the time that F troop happened forty percent of the cavalry was black.  Thirty-four percent of the Calvary was black, you don’t see any blacks on F troop. and you can't do what we did to blacks on F troop that were doing to these textbooks.  That's what we're talking about, were talking about that you know let's tell the truth as it was, not as we want to remember it to be. Let’s tell the truth as it happened not how it glorifies it if we tailor it this way or that.  Let's tell all the folks who Hendrick Arnold was so that black boys and black girls and boys and all girls of all colors can be inspired by him to serve their country.  Let's not omit him so they feel like nobody like him has served this country. (Moderator) Mr Bradley  (Bradley) I want to go back to an earlier statement that you made in the very first words of your opening and I think we're all sensitive, we got national media here and one thing that we want to do is be factually correct.  I want to follow up on Leo's earlier comments.  Her statement was that slavery, and having read the teaks, you stated that slavery was taken out of the teaks and the words trade triangle were reinserted, and we did a quick word search of the document that was adopted in March and could not find any reference to trade triangle, triangle trade from the word search just in world history but will continue to search slavery is identified as slavery both in teak number 7 C and in 4 I and we're going to go back to American history and work on that but again, we just want to tend to be accurate and I don't know the source of your assertion.  (Jealous) We will give you that side apologizing Lakes get least I think that's what venison (Moderator) Mrs. Nine (Nine) My other question is we are talking about the civil rights movement and the struggle and the outside agitation that had to take place, do you, uh, there's a section of our teaks that, I’m paraphrasing, that talks about minorities being given their rights by the majority.  How does that strike you, especially knowing that it was the Radical Republicans that were the ones that fostered giving certain rights to minorities. (1625-1740) (Jealous) Sure, it does not, we live in a representative democracy and oftentimes members of Congress come together and succeed in getting a majority of votes without having a majority of public opinion on their side and, you know, all that has been talked about these current times and how tense they are and how they remind people the early 1960s of Texas, for instance.  That suggestion, that is, that statement would leave a child ill-equipped to understand how change actually happened, how people are convinced, how pressure by powerful politicians like Senator Johnson to twist arms to get to those votes to actually happen.  It would also, um, you know, fail to comport, fail to comport with the reality walking into the Supreme Court and the reason why the Supreme Court was despised by so many people, dare I say the majority of people in this country in 1950.  So we have to be honest with our children, they need to understand what it is to have courage and the ways that you can win on the side of right even when the majority people oppose you.  That's why we have the Bill of Rights in the first place. (Moderator) Mr. Nunez (Nunez) Thank you very much for attending this board meeting, and thank you for representing your organization taking the time to come here  It is a very very important process and it will affect a number of states which will effect the teaching of a number of students nationwide so I really appreciate you being here.  I've got just a couple of questions for you.  A few years ago, I had the opportunity to go to st. Augustine Florida and learn of the struggle of a certain neighborhood did and the braveness of getting into a swimming pool at a certain hotel I'm sure you know what I’m talking about and their struggle.   Are events like is important for our US history book because it was a very significant point in time for the african-american population from this struggle for their freedom and we're talking the 1960s only 50 years ago now. (1855-2010)(Jealous) They are important, they help children understand why their grandfathers never were able to attain the rank, the top rank of the Boy Scouts, I stutter so I apologize but I was a boy scout so I know the ranks and it's an Eagles Scout, because you have to be able to swim to be an Eagle Scout, but if you can't get access to the swimming pool, you can't learn to swim, and it helps kids put in context of foolishness we still deal with today. Of course my office gets complaints from across the country.  I got complaints last summer from states as different as Pennsylvania & Louisiana about black kids being kept out of the swimming pool.  Warren Buffett’s sister had to bribe her city in Virginia in order to make it affordable because they were going to make the public's pool more expensive than the day rate at the Country Club to keep the black kids out.  The kids need to be able to put that into context.  All of our kids are beautiful and wonderful and should be able to go down to the neighborhood pool and we haven't even gotten to that perfect place just yet.  It has to be put in there.  It’s had a profound impact on our country as small as this is. (Moderator) Mrs. Cargill (Cargill) Mr. Jealous, I’m over here (Jealous) Oh,  I'm sorry, speakers always in place that's right (Cargill) Thank you for what you said. I really like what you said about the kids being able to all swim and I like that you're working on issues like that because you're absolutely right.  I've done a little digging because I like to dig through these teaks, I feel like I’ve memorized some, I did want to assure you that slavery as Bradley brought out that its cover twice in world history. I also discovered two places where the teachers will be expected to cover it in 7th grade and then three places world will be discovered in 8th grade and I did find the standard that we're talking about with the triangular trade let me read to you in 12v in eighth grade explain reasons for the development of the plantation system the Atlantic triangular trade and the spread of slavery if you do have an issue with that I would like to speak to you and your representative and see why that language is offensive but that language has not been taken out. (Jealous) Certainly that would still be beyond belief to talk about rum and sugar and cash and not talk about the people, but because people are so much more important the common phrasing is transatlantic slave trade and to change that to triangle trade for those of us who descend from those people who were treated like sugarcane is offensive but for all of us who believe in the principles of humanism and the value of humanity itself, I think would recognize the need to keep with the common phrasing which is transatlantic slave trade. (Cargill) Let me have you, talk to you about that. It was not changed, it was actually added by the board so there was no change, it was added, and I want to point out to you again that the role of  slavery is clearly given here in the instructions for the teachers and to the publisher to cover  (Jealous) and we're saying it's the primary purpose (Cargill) thank you (Moderator) Last question, Mr. Agosto (Agosto) One question, you represent one of the largest, most widely recognized grassroots organizations in the country, possibly the world, your basis is on the civil rights of the individual, and is your organization willing or ready to make an official statement that you stand behind your organization as far as that these standards should be delayed, should be analyzed based on the fact that maybe they do not adequately represent the  important significant contribution by certain minority individuals and is your organization ready to stand behind that? and also are you aware that I mean just, just the other day that Monday that California state appropriations committee, you know, they, they voted Monday recommending a bill that that they condemn, you know, that no textbooks are subject to curriculum changes made in Texas.  Is your organization ready to make a statement on that? (2326-2434) (Jealous) Yes, that's why I'm here, to ask you to delay this process.  We think it's, you know, this process teaches something to our children and sometimes our kids need to learn when you head down the wrong road the shortest way to get back to the right is to backup we're asking me to back up.  I'm here representing people in California who have been pushing for that.  The reality is we take our responsibility as the number one most trusted and recognized advocacy group in this country amongst all people, we take our responsibility to make sure that children are well informed very seriously and we will not just push as we are successfully in California. We’re pushing every single state that considers these textbooks.  We don't want to have to go there.  We’re here, we wanna push our country forward, not trying to keep it from running backwards. This, my mom was reading these teaks with me, a very well educated woman, says this is taking us in the directions with  the way I was taught in the 1940s.  That's why we're here slow down, back up and then move forward. (Moderator) Mr. Mercer (Mercer) Thank you for being here and I can tell you my last two merit badges in the Boy Scouts were not just for swimming but also life-saving, and I think you need the lifesaving badge to be an Eagle Scout.  I’m gonna ask you when you look at that jigsaw line, what's written in blue and underlined is what this board has added so could you support the question we have the section to talk about the philosophic influence/inspiration of Martin Luther King's I have a dream speech and his letter from Birmingham jail this board had a disagreement blue underlined and therefore you would agree with that that and that is very important.  (Jealous) sure  (Mercer) And we talked about the litigation cases, they are underlined. Brown v. Board of Education, Menendez v. Minister Edgewood ISD v. Kirby, those kinds of things also added by this board for discussion on civil rights movement, you agree with that too. (Jealous) sure (Mercer) Just want to make sure since I'm hearing so much not only from yourself but around the media again and they're saying that this board is done but a blue underlined means this board for the first time added those standards  (Jealous) Well thank you for that. We would like to still sit down because again, you know, as, you know, it's not about this piece or that piece, it's about all of it together, how certain things add up.  We’d like to have a conversation, slow it down. I’m speaking on behalf of thousands of people from this state and surrounding states. You perform an important service not just for the state but for the nation, and we're here to make sure that that service can be continued to be performed in a way that helps involve our children going forward.

  transcript: (LaChance) Hey it's Naomi LaChance with TYT Politics, I'm here today with Ben Jealous who just announced his candidacy for governor of Maryland. How are you today? (Jealous) I'm great (LaChance) So you announced your candidacy in Baltimore, what, why do you choose Baltimore? (Jealous) We chose my cousin's flower shop Baltimore blossoms.  It's a great name, it started just after the uprisings and it speaks to the yearnings and the, the power of the people of Baltimore and the people of our great state to move our state forward, no matter what else is happening, and that's what we need to be doing right now. You know, we've of course, we have to resist Trump and his horrible policies but we also have to get ready to move beyond resistance to actually move our cities and our counties and our states forward no matter what's happening in Washington (LaChance) And moving beyond resistance, what does that look like to you? (Jealous) It means, frankly, seizing the power that we have, you know, we as progressives for generations now have mourned the transfer of power from our federal government to our state governments, but in this moment, when extreme right-wingers control every branch of our federal government, it's time for us just to embrace what is and, and use the power in our states for good, to move our children's opportunities forward to move our, our state forward, our families forward, make it possible to actually put a high quality teacher in every classroom, or to hold police officers who have killed unarmed civilians accountable, or to ensure that everybody here has access to health care (LaChane) Current Maryland governor Larry Hogan, he's a Republican, he vetoed a bill that would insure five days of paid sick leave for workers and small businesses, saying it would be disastrous for the economy what do you think would be too much paid sick leave.  (Jealous) You know, the reality is, is that everybody who's working needs the same thing, right, you need a dependable schedule, you need a fair wage, and you need to know that when you're sick, you can take care of yourself, you need to have health care. Our governor had an opportunity to stand up for working people and he sat down instead. (LaChance) So this is five days, what do you think seems appropriate? (Jealous) Folks need at least five days.  I think most folks would say they need at least two weeks.  The reality is that you can get sick and your child can get sick, and no worker should fear losing a job because they need to stay home to take care of a sick kid or, frankly, not, be able to take care of themselves so they don't go to work and spread that virus to somebody else (LaChance) On a sort of similar note you've said you're in favor of a $15 an hour minimum wage what do you what do you see as the highest it could go? (Jealous) Right now, we have an opportunity to ensure that work pays again in our state. That, that, that every parent can go to bed at night knowing that just working a 40-hour week is enough to cover the basement, the basic necessities for their family.  The reality is that nobody wants a minimum job, more than you want a minimum house or a minimum car, um, but we've got to set up floor somewhere, and the reality is that the if minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it'd be at $15.  If it had kept up with productivity, it'd be at $19.  It seems to me like $15 is a reasonable place to start, so let's go ahead and make that happen for working families across our state (LaChance) You were previously a fellow at the Center for American Progress and emails when you came out in favor of Bernie, emails in the Podesta Wikileaks hack, showed them pretty unhappy with you having done that, maybe a little bit betrayed.  How far are you going to compromise in terms of engaging Democrats across and, and the left across the spectrum? (Jealous) I'm a proud progressive whose entire career has been grounded in my years as a community organizer and as a civil rights leader.  I have a track record of standing up despite the odds, despite the heat, to do the right thing.  I did that here when I led the state, built a movement here that succeeded in abolishing the death penalty.  I did that again in the same year here when it was time to actually help pull in black leadership to pass marriage equality.  I did it again that same year when it was time to again pull in leadership across the state to pass the DREAM Act, and I'm sure I've gone to jail for protests more than anybody else who's running for governor across this country.  The reality is that you know CA_ is a, is supposed to be a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, so I'm not sure why my colleagues there, if they felt betrayed, felt betrayed by me standing up with, with Bernie. I'm a progressive and I stood up with a very, with a very proudly progressive candidate to push for the sorts of policies that we talked about at CAP as fellows.  So, you know, it's, um, this is, all you can do is run as yourself and for my entire life, I’m the children of organizers, I started out working as a community organizer when I was 18 and I'm going to run like the proud progressive community organizer that I am.  (LaChance) So a young black man Richard Collins III was stabbed to death at the University of Maryland.  I know, um, you attended his funeral.  So the University of Maryland did make some changes, but I know a lot of leaders have said they're not enough. What do you think? (Jealous) Leaders across the state right now are on a journey trying to figure out what is going on, that we've had two young white men stab black men to death apparently just because of their race just in the past six months.  One from around Towson went up to New York City, pulled out a sword and killed a black man.  One in college park pulled out a long knife and killed his fellow student. It’s like the story of Cain and Abel.  I commend all of those who have dug down deep and asked the question what more?  What more can we do?  So a lot of good first steps, but we've got to stay on that journey.  The thing that inspires me most, I was at his memorial at Bowie State, I was at his funeral, is the resilience of his family and the commitment of his friends and his classmates at Bowie State and at College Park.  Young people coming together across lines of race and religion to say we're going to move forward together, we're going to create the world that we’re destined to create a more inclusive, vibrant, productive place, we're not going to fall victim to the hate. And that's frankly where I put my hope. I put my hope with your generation. I put my hope with the young people rising up in this state for home frankly the history of division oppression matters less in shaping how they comport their own lives. (LaChance) Maryland Democrats have said that if funding to Planned Parenthood, federal funding gets cut, they will come in and provide that funding instead. a Planned Parenthood in Silver Spring was just shut down. How are you going to help ensure that people have proper reproductive care? (Jealous) My grandma is a hundred years old. She started her career working for Planned Parenthood in Baltimore in 1940.  My family has always been supportive and raised me to be the same way of a woman's right to choose and to control her own destiny and to, as well as the struggle to ensure that everybody who needs quality health care gets access to it.  Planned parenthood sits right at the juncture of, of both of those movements, of both of those needs.  We must as a state, in this moment, be prepared to provide quality affordable health care to everybody in Maryland, no matter what happens in Washington, and I commend my colleagues, frankly the Democrats at the State Capitol, for the leadership they've shown on this issue.  (LaChance) You are a professor a visiting professor at Princeton Woodrow Wilson School.  Some African-American students have called for Woodrow Wilson's name to be removed for the legacy that he represents, for segregating the federal government.  How should we engage with that history? (Jealous) I mean, I'm a visiting professor so my power on the matter is limited.  I've been very supportive of my students, both publicly and privately in their quest to get the, the name removed.  He was a member of the Ku Klux Klan and I, um, you know, agree with folks who say, you know, generally, like when, when buildings are named a long time ago, we should respect the history.  There are exceptions and members of terrorist organizations are one of the things that we make exceptions for. (LaChance) I mean how do you, how do you deal with being at that school then? (Jealous) The same way I think that anybody, I mean, you know, the reality with, what college did you go to? (LaChance) I went to Bard College. (Jealous) Have you dug into the history of the northeastern liberal arts schools and where their money came from?  You know, the reality is, I went to Columbia University.  I'm a Rhodes Scholar, um, you look at Brown University, it feels like it's miles away from slavery, yet it was funded by so. (LaChance) You’re at a school that's named after a KKK member. (Jealous) I'm at the, my school, teaching young people at today one of the few schools in the Ivy League where students are accumulating no debt, and the reality is that in our society, the way that we change things is that we engage, that we get involved, that we add our voices, that we add our support, and we keep pushing now.  When I was a student, we succeeded at Columbia in getting a center to teach about the history of people of color in this country, to actually include us into the, into the curriculum and ethnic studies department.  We fought that fight for 25 years.  If you give up and you walk away, the great victories don't happen.  So, you know, that's, that's how you change things, is you dig in and you fight.  That's what my life has been as an organizer, and, you know, and that's, what we as progressives are when we're at our best.  If you just sort of tuck tail and walk away nothing changes.

  transcript: (Cenk) So joining me now, the new Democratic nominee for the governor of Maryland and what, of course, progressives hope is the soon-to-be governor of Maryland, Ben Jealous. Ben, great to have you here and congrats on your victory last night. (Jealous) Thank You Cenk its, you know, we're pretty happy yeah  (Cenk) Yeah so Ben your victory breaks down into two parts and I think they are equally important and that's why we featured your race prominently on The Young Turks overall for the whole network.  One was the primary where it was a classic matchup of the progressive versus the more establishment candidate, and you come from the Bernie Sanders wing and you were a surrogate for Sanders.  You come from the progressive can-do wing of the party.  Your opponent unfortunately came from the well, let's not try things too much wing now that race is settled.  I want to talk about that for a second and then I want to talk about the really important race, you’re having the general election because that also is really important for a different reason, but let's just talk about the race that you just won.  So a lot of the Maryland politicians were on your opponent's side and they said, well, you're trying for too much change and they imply that you didn't have enough executive experience, which I thought was a little offensive given that you led the NAACP for five years and all the other organizations that you've led, but how did how did that get settled?  You know, tell me about the dynamics of that race and why you think you won that race. (Jealous) Well there's two questions there, how did it get settled and how did we win.  I mean, you know, how it ended was actually pretty good.  A lot of those long-standing leaders of our party had frankly called me before they endorsed my opponent, told me that they had cut that deal two years ago, that they had no choice and a few of them even said that they would, that actually hoped I would win, and so we, you know, frankly there's, we're a family here and we know each other, we respect each other and it was it's very easy to come together at the end of this.  How we won is the way that we will win again.  We traveled to every corner of the state and we listened to people early on, and then from that point on we talked to people about what it would actually take to solve the real problems facing their families in real time and we just did it again and again, talking about how we finally fully fund our public schools, talking about how we end mass incarceration and take the money that we save and use that to bring down the cost of college for young people and the cost of graduate school, and we talked about how we finally get our healthcare costs under control by simply doing what every other the Western nation has already done and by doing that again and again.  It worked.  You know, people, it doesn't matter and if you're in West Baltimore or Western Maryland, chances are the issues facing your family are the same. I mean there can, you know, be things around the edges and there can be a big local issue, but 80 percent of the issues will be the same.  (Cenk) What I love to dive into is the mechanics of how people won, especially if their progressives, so that the movement can learn lessons and can apply it to other races.  So your race was neck-and-neck for a long time, and, and people were not sure who was going to win.  And as it turned out, you won by about 10 points, which is a very comfortable margin in, in that context. So, what do you think were the different things that you guys did in your campaign, whether it was volunteers, or how you raised money?  I don't know, you tell me, that you think made a difference in getting that victory? (Jealous) The decisive decision for us was to spend time very early on pulling a union after union, environmentalist group after environmentalist group, big progressive organization and after neighborhood progressive organization, because we knew, frankly, how to win.  My campaign manager and I met when I was leading the effort to abolish the death penalty in the state, and he was managing the effort to pass the DREAM Act, and I became co-chair of that campaign too and we won those big victories.  We helped pass marriage equality, and we learned that year that the way to win in our state, quite frankly, is to get as many groups as possible to declare the motto of the three musketeers, and just say all for one and one for all, and we knew from the very beginning if we just built a bigger, more robust coalition than anybody else, we would win.  Now the risk that we took early on is I was just told straight up look man, you're gonna raise money for a campaign, you're basically building a bicycle.  A bicycle is gonna have two wheels; one of those are contributions that come from individuals, and, frankly, they're gonna tend to be rich folks and they're gonna be pretty high average donation, and the other is corporate contributions.  And I said, well, look, I'm just willing to ride a unicycle and if that means if we lose out to the bicycles, I will lose this race on that alone.  As it turned out, we ended up having more individual donations than any other candidate, and, frankly, more individual donations then all the other candidates put together.  99.9% of our contributions came from people.  The other point one percent owed, one-tenth of one percent, actually slightly less than that, came from trade unions and small businesses,  many of those small businesses were giving things in kind like food to the campaign from Busboys and poets, and we shocked people because we raised money faster than anybody else and we did it with the lowest average donation in the race, almost half of the guy running on the public option, and so we showed so you can win a Democratic primary in Maryland bidding 99.9% of your money from real people (Cenk) And, and Ben's campaign raised 3 million dollars, which is an amazing total when it comes from individual donations.  It wouldn't be an amazing total if it was corporate PAC money then you could raise that fairly quickly, but it was a bold and important and correct and progressive decision to not do that and, and by the way, one of the reasons that Ben Jealous got the endorsement of the Just Democrats, and it was a huge night for that organization last night as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who was a Just Democrat from day one, the first candidate ever, and Ben Jealous won, so huge night for progressives all over.  Also, let's talk about your upcoming race.  Now, Larry Hogan, as things stand are, is a popular governor of Maryland and so the second reason why your race is so important is because there is an idea out there that if you want to beat someone like Larry Hogan you have to go towards the right wing and you have to be, just, you know, in the centrist camp.  Now, you're also defying that, you're saying no, I'm going to run as a progressive in the general election as well. I'm not gonna do any pivots etc, so if you win doing that strategy, it will be a really important test for the progressive movement.  That's why I think it's really important for all progressives watching this to make sure that you continue to support Ben because that campaign is a testing ground.  It's important for all of us, so talk to me about your strategy about how to win the general election. (Jealous) You know, look I've said from the very beginning, I can't zigzag because I have size 14 feet and I'll trip.  You know, we're just going to keep running in one direction and quite honestly, it's not towards the left, it's not towards the right, it’s towards the people.  I come into this as the former national president of the NAACP, and I know that when I worked in states, frankly states far more conservative than our state, to shrink their prison system more rapidly.  We did it with bipartisan support because we listened to people and we pulled folks together, you know, we got fiscal conservatives who were just concerned the prison system was growing too rapidly.  We got libertarians who, frankly, agree with us on a bunch of criminal justice issues now, and we got Christian conservatives to join with progressives to join with the civil rights community because frankly, they're in the prisons, doing prison ministry and they understand what few folks do, which is that we don't just have the most incarcerated black and brown people on the planet, we also have the most incarcerated white people on the planet and it's destroying their families too and, quite frankly, what they tend to have in common is that those families were too poor to afford their own lawyer, and so that taught me a real lesson when I was running the NAACP, is that when you run towards the people, you can create a new center, a center founded on courage and common sense and that's what we're doing in this race because, quite frankly, you know, having loved ones who are addicted to heroin or to pills, that's not a partisan issue it's a people issue.  Struggling to pay student debt, not a partisan issue it's a people issue.  Worried that your kids are not getting a great education at public schools, not a partisan issue but a people issue.  Worried that our tax system isn't fair, that it, you know, let's hedge fund managers pay a, a lower tax rate then their secretaries, while we have senior citizens on fixed incomes are having their houses foreclosed on in Baltimore because they can't afford their property taxes.  That's a people issue too, and so we're just going to run straight towards the people, and we're going to have courage to speak frankly, common sense, put real solutions on the table.  You know, Cenk, one of the gifts I had in my life is that a hundred and one year old Maryland social worker who helped train Barbara Mikulski also helped train me.  She's my grandmother and she told me again and again, baby, don't try to half solve a problem because you still got a problem.  So my idea with the people of Maryland is simple.  When I bring you a solution, it'll be for the whole problem.  We will talk honestly about what it will take and then we'll fight hard and we'll get it done.  What I'm known for in the state, the reason I was named Marylander of the year in 2013 by the Baltimore Sun and then endorsed by them again, quite frankly, it's because I've succeeded again and again and getting big things done in our state and that's what I'll do as governor.

  transcript: (Charitan) Obviously tonight there was a lot of talk about the special interest donations, this and that, in terms of Bernie really striking a chord with the African-American community, do you think he did something different tonight that might show in the results of New York? (Jealous) What we've seen is that the support with black voters continues to build.  You know, the most important split in this race, if you will, and that, you know, amongst voters our party, isn’t black versus white its young versus old.  It’s voters 30 and under, voters 60 and over, and what we've seen is that over time, those younger voters are turning more and more the older voters as they say to them why is it that you guys are so passionate for Bernie and what the answer they get back is he's the only one that we trust to actually give us a better future.  And so what we saw, right, was that as voters first got to know him in the Super Tuesday States, support was in the teens ,it was pretty low.  Then we moved into the Midwest a couple weeks later, it was up around 30.  Now last week, a poll comes out from the University of Maryland and the Washington Post says black support in Maryland it's at 38 points.  Why is that important?  Well first of all, it's surged over the over the two weeks prior. We got two weeks at that point left to go, now we’ve got about a week and a half.  Second, what you were seeing was that we were, we were actually, we had punched through the ceiling we saw in the Midwest, so my theory is quite frankly when we have more time, when we talk more about trade, and when we all and when folks really, frankly, listen to the young people in our community, we get more and more support.  (Charitan) Do you think part of the problem is, you know, right here CNN this morning you have an anchor saying, oh, well, he had a big rally but most of them are Occupy Wall Street members and NYU students, which I thought was kind of asinine to say.  Do you think that african-americans and to all people aren't really being exposed to the movement behind them because TV news doesn't cover it that much? (Jealous) You know, I mean CNN is a, is a, is a perplexing predicament for us because when you look at you know whose employees have donated the most to her campaign, Time Warner comes out number six . (Charitan) Seven. (Jealous) Okay, well, so then they've slipped since I saw it three weeks ago when (Charitan) They don't disclose that either (Jealous) No, no and so you know I think that's, that's been frustrating to us the spin seems to reflect that sometimes.  They have great people on there, folks who are your honest and hardworking, but there's a certain tilt to the overall network that leaves a lot to be desired.  There are 48,000 New Yorkers in the street; 27,000 the park, 21,000 in the streets, all there to hear Bernie.  We saw the very start of this kind of push here in New York.  She struggled to have 1,500 people into a theater in Harlem the next day in the South Bronx, and if you know the two it’s really one larger community.  We're over 18,000. What's, what's critical, quite frankly, is whether we can keep, we win when voter turnout goes up all over.  Her going negative drives it down.  We have to stay focus on our fundamentals just turnout, turnout rate. if we turnout those folks, this is done.  (Charitan) It's a good question because I've spoken with a lot of voters this week and they're all disenfranchised.  Whether, you know, there was a, there was a deadline in October to change voter affiliation. I don't know a lot of young people, white or black, that are paying attention in October, six months before a primary. Other, other instances are you concerned that because it's a closed primary here in other places because a lot of these states have arcane rules that a lot of people are going to be disenfranchised  (Jealous) One of the things I'm most excited about is, is what comes after this because, because frankly, you have all these young people getting engaged and they're realizing how broken our democracy is and our democracy, no matter what happens, we'll be stronger because they're gonna challenge the super delegate process.  They're gonna make it more fair if they don't get rid of it entirely. They're gonna challenge these arcane rules, they're really, they're quite frankly there to benefit the status quo, but we also have a lot of young people who are signed up to vote here and if they turn out we could shock the entire world. (Charitan) thanks Ben

  transcript: 0014- Today is the day to begin to unify so we can defeat Donald Trump, and I’m looking forward to joining him along with all of us to take back the Senate, erect great local and state change makers and defeat Trump, and make Hillary Clinton President of these Unites States. 0118 to 0150- Well you know we came through a primary and now we have 105 days to keep a madman out of the white house and we know what happened in 2000 and the reality is that we cannot afford to end up with having an Iraq because we narrowly lose the White House to somebody who should not be there as we did with Bush, so the reality is here you go through a primary you come into convention and you come out one campaign in this case, to hold onto the White House and keep it you know a neo-fascist from becoming President. 0204 to 0308- if you look at the utter racism that Trump has directed towards people in this country there is no reason to think that he will not do the same thing when he’s actually you know has his finger on the button he is clearly same saying you have some sort of love affair going on with Putin I don’t know who that gives comfort to and he has all the personality characteristics of some of the worst dictators and tyrants we have seen around the world but the reality is here that he will also destroy voting rights, women’s rights, workers rights- he will put in a Supreme Court that will take us back very quickly we used to think that the Voting Rights Act pretty was much with sacrosanct in this country its been you know your great damage has been done to it this is the first presidential and quite frankly you know you’re my roots as you know my family so much of it is in West Baltimore and communities like that suffer greatly when we sort of pretend like who’s a president who is the president does not matter and we cannot afford to go through you know George W Bush on steroids. 0939 to 1141– Look what you saw yesterday was the beginning of a convention, people come and having fought each other they go out fighting together and you look at the beginning and people you know show up as they show up but you know let’s be honest you know if Jill was running for mayor or Congress or Senate I might be supporting her there’s a lot of issues that we absolutely agree on if you’re going to build a party building from the bottom up win some seats in Congress win some seats in the Senate you started the presidency why because you get more money for your party you can get five percent and you can get some more money for your party and what was the cost of that in two thousand? The Iraq war and how much did that cost us and how much does that cost our children in the future, the reality is we have a responsibility when our earth is in such peril to not be flying kites and investing in fantasies- to actually do the hard work of organizing and the real hard work we all know is actually in the streets. Once you get somebody in office, we don’t elect presidents to make change happen but you going to be willing to build a movement frankly I only hear about the Green Party when somebody’s running for President in most places I never hear about winning in Congress I never hear about winning an I said I wish I sis but the reality is at the Green Party in Europe often times joins with people who are center leftist or even you know folks that don’t typically agree with because they have a different system and quite frankly they’re much more strategic and much more effective at actually pulling the country to the left, that’s what Bernie Sanders and our progressive movement inside of the Democratic Party are doing, I agree we can have a much better system but you know what we have the system that we have and its different I think when the community that you are most connected to can afford for, you know, this to be lost or that to be lost but I’m rooting a black community that’s been devastated by tax on its rights, that’s been devastated by mass incarceration and my responsibility is to deliver real results for real people that transforms real families lives I don’t have time to kind of play games with fantasies. 1805 to 1842- You know, fool me once shame on me fool me twice shame on you, and the reality I would say exactly and the reality is there is a lot of things we agree on what would we agree on but what is not we can talk about, our fantasy is visions for the future, but we cant deny the facts, the past George W Bush got into the White House because Al Gore lost by about 900 votes in Florida, Ralph Nadar had 90,000, the report the studies that wen back and looked at these voters had sixty percent of them would have gone for Gore if Nadar wasn’t on the ballot, there I’m all for (gets cut off) 1851 to 2002– This sis the part that kills me, right, is that we’ll acknowledge that you know Joe Liberman was not a great choice for vice president and we’ll acknowledge that they were democrats who voted for republicans but then when it gets to this factor we pretend like it had no effect and it did and the reality is that yes we need this parties and you know I would defend you know the rights and I’ve gone to jail frankly in multiple states defending people’s rights to participate, I believe there should be third parties I’ve thought for rank choice voting I would love to see you guys get something to me mayor of Oakland and not just Richmond but the reality is that what you do is start with the presidency and you don’t think about the consequences for you to sit here an suggest the people should vote for you in swing states is irresponsible and in the realities of the Trump is in the White House, yes we will blame a lot of things and we will talk about all the mistakes and yes we should have had Bernie sanders who absolutely was pulling much higher and is strong, we can go through all that will all that Monday morning quarterbacking, we will also talk about the role of the Green Party if you guys are going to go in there and people have a choice from, yes a neo-liberal a neo-fascist and then the green party in a swing state helps the neo-fascist (gets cut off) 2034 to 2148–So we will look and we will go through the votes, I’m an organizer I deal with specific numbers by precinct by state and quite frankly when I come to somebody and say you know we can abolish the death penalty or state we go out there with a strategy and we usually get it done when I was had in their blades if he would have in six states in six years tough issue but the reality happens in the Democratic platform absolutely and you know you don’t come to the people with a pipe dream you come to the people with a plan its creative big bold dreams I push them all the time I’m not going to waste your time unless I know that we have a good chance of winning I mean you know lets place odds on the Green Party you know having the next president of these Unites States its not going to happen so then lets talk about our families how we actually get things better I would love to get to know to make progress, yard by yard, but inches ass up to yards and the reality is that winning in Congress, winning in Senate we could talk about, I would love to strategize about how to actually get Greens into federal office but starting with the presidency, again, the sig state a vote for the Green Party is going to help the neo-fascist right now and we have a hundred and five days and we cant mess with. 2812 to 3212– Absolutely and I stand right where Bernie does, be really clear I am still a Bernie Sanders surrogate still very much building this revolution, we’re building together we are progressives who understand how to build power, Bernie’s an organizer I’m and organizer and the reality is part of being an organizer and being a leader is making tough strategic decisions so you can actually deliver the best results for the families of this country what you saw Bernie do last night was to really get people to take stock of how we’ve transformed this party so our folks are in the room and realize that they have made bigger , they have transformed the platform of the party, we saw what the first draft was not its you know one of the most progressive and history as one of the most progressive in history because of the influence and the end of the fight frankly that we brought to that process you know a week ago we though we super delegates may have the same unwavering influence for decades as they had with decades I sat with reverend Jackson on Sunday we were in church together, he was very clear the progress we have made against super delegates will add up to more change than what he was able to do we had him abolished for a minute and then reimposed by the deeds (Jill Stein interrupts) so what we have actually is an agreement that you know will go through our process but it literally says “shall” so you know it’s a process with a obligated outcome which is to reduce the number of super delegates by about two thirds- there would just be the governors and congress people (interrupted by interviewer) this is a promise because when you’re in the minority you actually sometimes have to negotiate the outcome in advance otherwise all you have is a process right and then the other ones will be essentially turned into pledge delegates they will still have office but they will have to vote the way of their states and will have to be apportioned as their states were apportioned it’s a big deal year we’ve you know it’s the same thing we went through quite frankly in the movement to abolish the death penalty we have one victory in ’72, it turns around us in ’76, I come on the nation staff in ’96, we hadn’t won anything in 20 years we go the the board, I wont talk about how progressives sometimes we struggle with each other because this is a family conversation that’s why I dodged it this morning right because we are all family cause some of us fight inside and some of us fight outside but there’s a reason why we agree on so much which is why we’ve been in the trenches for a long time together and we can aboard the National Coalition, we said we are going to go state-by-state strategy, it has to be all or nothing it’s immoral if its all or nothing but what we have dine now we have abolished the death penalty in about 20 states in this country, we’ve abolished entirely for juveniles entirely for adults that how you get change to add up and that’s where Bernie Sanders is doing to the party which is why he says yes Hillary Clinton and I actually agree on some things we agree on making this country better for children, we agree on increasing the inclusion of women into our society, she’s a fierce advocate for women and for children, you know we now agree on the TTP grants she isn’t start out there, but you know what go back and look at the history of RFK there’s a lot of things when he was hanging out with J Edgar Hoover that we didn’t agree on but the movement pushed him and the reality is that we are pushing her to it but will also hold her accountable there is anybody in that room that feels like Bernie Sanders- if four years from now there was you know we has been betrayed would be a very different force to be reckoned with but the reality is that we as progressives don’t just have a responsibility to our ideals we have a responsibility to people who need real change, and Bernie Sanders understands that the way to get real change in this moment is to simply push for the best of the two viable choices that we have and then hold them accountable and that’s what we will do while electing progressives at the local level.

  transcript: 0008- Good Evening (clapping) and again I know you’ve heard it before but welcome to Baltimore this is the home to the headquarters of the NAACP and actually this town- my father went to jail 36 years ago, no 1966, a long time ago in 1966 desegregating desks downtown’s that conventions like this can be held here people of all races of all identities enjoying being together and that’s separated by some silly laws, now I’m really grateful for Ray’s leadership Ray is a good friend she’s a courageous leader you’re my father taught me a long time ago and I should say he was the one white guy in jail that day desegregating this downtown Convention Center that week actually took a long time I said Son its okay to be afraid we all get afraid sometimes the question is what do you do with that fear if you are- if you act in spite of that fear you are hero if you act because of that fear you are coward. Ray is a hero and I’m grateful for her leadership in Washington and as you’ve heard the struggle for lesbian bisexual gay transgender equality is near and dear to my heart, my brother Jason whom I was raised faced discrimination at a very early age because of his transgender identity. It didn’t strike us as odd, he had been dressing in dresses and wearing wigs and singing Diana Ross since he was 2. But as I’ll talk about some other folks didn’t quite see it the same way. I stand before you today as an individual, deeply vested in this struggle, but also as the leader of an organization with strong connections to the fight for LGBT rights. The past few years the Association has experienced a renaissance- membership is up three years in a row, the first time in over 20 years and as we have expanded our membership and our staff and our programs- including a major focus and ensuring that HIV does not become the forgotten epidemic in this country- we have also socks of more fully embraces the diversity within our own ranks. Recently, the Jackson State chapter of the NAACP, a chapter I helped to organize when the governor Fordise to try to turn a college into a prison, chose a 30 year old white man to be the head of their chapter, both a non-traditional student and a non-traditional Jackson State student in many ways. Our chapter in New Jersey chose and Honduran immigrant to be their leader and in Worcester Massachusetts, my father went to college, the branch in Worcester which had been dormant for five years has been revitalized by a new president who is a 28 year old black gay professor (clapping). 0430- Tomorrow’s NAACP leaders wont just be inspired by the words of Dr. King or the deeds of WB Dubois or Wells or the ongoing fight to end over incarceration but yeah- I will take that. 7 million prisoners on earth, 2 million in the United States. Either we must believe that our neighbors are that much more evil than everybody else on earth, or we’re doing something very very wrong in this county. (clapping). But not only will they be inspired, but they’ll be inspired by our ongoing work in places like Alabama to defend the rights of immigrants. (clapping). Our work to champion intolerance and push back against religious intolerance across this country and our work to ensure that the LGBT community is not discriminated against in employment or in any other aspect of their life. A leading employer in the nonprofit sector in the state of Maryland we will be there in Annapolis to make sure that the gender identity anti-discrimination bill is passed. It is consistent with the advocacy we have already done to push Congress to finally pass the employment non-discrimination Act and we asked them, all of you, who live here in Maryland, who are willing to come back to Maryland to help us abolish the death penalty and do right by the memory or Troy Davis. But the striving for inclusion is not new. The NAACP, the task force and many other LGBT leadership organizations across this country have fought together since before the days when when Byard Rustin planned the march on Washington in 1963, you know the personal no I will never forget meeting Byard’s partner talk about a courageous guy said, ‘You know Ben, when I went home to tell my mom about my new boyfriend I wasn’t quite sure what scared me more- having to tell her that he was black, that I was gay, or that he was as old as she was.’ He’s a good man and he continues to push to make sure that people don’t forget Byard, and frankly all of us, and the progressive movement would be right to study him I’ve been told that for entire win fog the Tea Party he is their favorite author so if the Tea Party’s learning from Byard Druffs and we should make sure that we’re learning from him too but he was a black gay hero who literally wrote the textbook for mobilizing the masses to Washington for Jobs and Freedom and it was very consciously in the spirit of I owed Rusin that we planned one nation working together intentionally to be the most inclusive and affirming march for jobs that our nations capital has ever seen the Byard came back we wanted him to come back and see something that was more welcoming to him than even his march was the coalition what we put together has been effective not in spite of the diversity of the groups involved last year the NAACP went deeper internally e actually had our first NAACP town hall meeting at a National Convention on LGBT issues led by our former chairman Julia Bond. 0908- But this is about the work and you know as somebody whose parents once has to drive from a church in Washington DC all the way back to their home in Baltimore to celebrate their wedding because their marriage was illegal here and this is a point of personal privilege. Somebody who had to grow up with the hatred that people felt empowered to cash on us as a family because they knew that my parent’s marriage, until very recently, had been illegal. I’m very proud of the leadership of the Baltimore branch and standing up for marriage equality. Just as the California in NAACP though prop 8, just as William Barber, president of the North Carolina NAACP called me today and said ‘make sure that crowd knows that we are doing everything we can to stop that silly amendment from becoming law.’ Tonight I want to share with you my own personal story about making a choice at a very young age of the best antidote to hatred is unity I was born in the village of Carmel California community, that’s (someone yells from the crowd) -A31 in the house you doing!- y’all got to understand that place is one mile square so that a pretty special experience right there. There was only one of the black boy in town that we knew of that was my age we sort of lived in the heart of Carmel because he lived right across the street that was black neighborhood. Our house, his house and as it turned out his mom was my mom’s best friend or older sisters were each other’s best friends from the age of six moths he was my best friend. We got used to, by the time we were four people were asking us if we were brothers. We just looked at each other and said yeah we’re brothers and that the only word we’d ever used to describe each other ever since and it made more and more sense as his mom even after I moved off to college moved back in for ten years to my parents his sister and his nephew live with me in my house the last three years I raced his nephew as my nephew because we are brothers and I am his uncle too. And our first fight was very clearly our fight we were the two black boys in town and even when we moved to towns over the manager of the five and dime would chaperone us to every ails of the store as out white friends ran around willy-nilly and they would stare at us like what did you do wrong to deserve that? Then just keep on right now we knew why we were being chaperones cause we were black and we were different but a few years later for our peers became a much bigger deal that Jason would occasionally wear a wig outside the house or make up outside the house or come to the door in a dress. And some of those friends who would actually stood with us white kids fighting out white bullies who are picking on the black kids. I mean, it was very clear to me that maybe this time I should let those kids hatred be Jason’s issue and not seek to fight this one too. And I sat there in that moment and I had to make a very quick decision because the fight was about to start and I decided that quite frankly whether you say that you don’t like us cause we ain’t like you are or you don’t like us because I hang out with him and he ain’t like us. If you pick a fight with my brother, you pick a fight with me. These are the very human realities and bounds that pontiffs ignore when they seek to stereotype the black community, black leadership or even black clergy. This is why I’m so proud that the NAACP bought ads organized masses of activists to make sure that Matthew Shepard James Byrd Hate Crime Act became law. Oppression is oppression is oppression is hatred and is hatred is hatred and because of that law, now all hate crimes are protected regardless of where they occur or whom is targeted. Now, let me say as I was coming here tonight and I was thinking about James Byrd I was thinking about Matthew Anders about Matthew Shepard and I was thinking about James Anderson and you know how the press really wanted to get into well did they go after James I understand because he was black. Oh did they go after James Anderson because he was gay? my brothers been addicted to drugs and he’s in and out of sorrows in the Tenderloin and when the police beat him up, he’s never quite sure the picking on him because he lives in an SRO or they are picking on him because he’s black or they are picking on him because he is gay or all of the above. 1528- Hatred is hatred is hatred, violence is wrong no matter where is happened and I really don’t care whether they went after a man because he was black or because he was gay or because he was black and gay or because they though he was just simply- I don’t care. And thank you, thank all of you for standing up to get that bill through but you know quite frankly what’s even more of a threat to our own success in the media’s failure to recognize our common struggles its often our own failure to come together on issues of a common interest. We at the NAACP believes that America moves closer to truly being America when we expand access to quality education for all when we expand access to financial opportunity for all and when we expand access to the ballot and political power for all. As Frederick Douglass observed in a speech against the Chinese exclusion act in the late 1860s or early 1870s, speech entitles our composite nationality, and this is a paraphrase it was a little more florid than I am- ‘every nation has a destiny which is defined by that nations character and every nation’s character tends to be defined by that nations geography and our nations geography isn’t unique because it is bordered by two nations and surrounded by two oceans’ and he said ‘our destiny as a nation defined by that geography, is to be the most perfect example of human unity that the world has ever seen.’ This is, what we in the civil rights community what the task force and the NAACP do, we empower America to be America, we empower America to be truly the most perfect example of you, of human unity the world has ever seen, that must be our goal. And that is why whether a child is bullied by another student because of her sexual orientation or gender identity, or a child is mistreated by a principal or a teacher because of his race- point here Texas last year a study was complete they looked at 1 million children’s school discipline records, found no factor more deterrent if of whether how a child will be punished by their school than their race. That regardless of whether that child’s being bullied because of their sexual orientation or gender identity or being targeted for unfair suspension because of their race the task force and the NAACP must stand up together because a child who’s being bullied or discriminated against in their school does not have fair access to quality education. (clapping). That is why whether fighting to end discrimination against LGBT people at work or black folks at the bank- the NCAAP and the task force must be strong together because when you or community is the target of any “ISM” in the marketplace, ending discrimination is as important as job creation and ending the virus of hatred anywhere requires stamping it our everywhere. And that is why in this moment, when our nation is in the midst of the greatest wave of voter suppression legislation that our nation has seen since literally before the creation of the NAACP. 2010- The greatest wave of voter suppression legislation that our nation has experienced since before the creation of the NAACP, you literally have to go back to the 1890s to find a year when we excluded more people from the voting process with new laws than we have done in the past year. In this moment, we have to stand together. We have to recognize our common interests in an expanded electorate that looks more like the future than like the past. In 2011 alone, more than 30 states across the county introduced legislation to suppress the vote. It comes in the form of strict photo ID bills. Bills that are so strict my black grandmother in Missouri, who has voted pretty much all of her adult life in Missouri, no longer can vote because she has to have an ID that requires her to have her birth certificate, her original birth certificate, not a duplicate, and she went she having lost hers somewhere across the last eight decades, she went back to the court house in her home county in Mississippi and found out but not too long after she was born it had burned down and her birth certificate has been destroyed with it, but with the law is so stringent with no exceptions, she literally has been blocked from voting. (clapping) Amen. But then behind the voter ID laws come registration ID laws. These laws say, that we will not even process your voter registration form unless a Xerox of your driver’s license or your passport is attached by July of last year. Already 40,000 voter registration forms have been literally centrally put in the trash in the state of Arizona alone because people’s IDs weren’t attached. Now, raise you hand I you’ve ever participate din a voter registration drop all right it’s a lot of folks. Keep them up give them up give them up now please keep them up if you’ve ever done that while pushing a Xerox machine down the street, that’s the point they want to make it hard for us to sign up folks. To vote in Florida came to their senses a little bit after Bush v Gore. You know, Jeb Bush and Charlie Crist teamed up and they looked at the whole issue of excluding formerly incarcerated people from voting and they decided not to do it anymore and then you know some conservatives were alright with that but some other conservatives a lot of libertarians- for instance, were very goof in this issue but some other conservatives were a bit peeved that the next major presidential election that came through somebody a different party won that state and so what did the next Republican governor do?? He got rid of the executive order and this year there will be 500,000 Floridian’s who were able to vote in 2008 who wont be able to vote this year simple because they have resurrected an ex felon voting band. Bands so undeniably racist that you can literally go back to the legislative history from when they were first introduced in states that range from New York to Virginia to Mississippi and find statements like this one from the 1906 Virginia constitutional convention rough paraphrase- but maybe three words are wrong where they said the word the word darky here though is absolutely from that a direct quote when embedding their law into their constitution where it still stands one of the worst ex-felon bands in the country banned you for life because of their plan the darky will be eliminated as a factor in this states politics in the next five years. Well, that’s what’s in the legislative history from the 19th century and your governor in the 21st century what about that makes you think it’s a good idea unless that’s exactly what you want to do? Now, on top of all that I mean we literally have stated that are trying to pass voter ID laws they’re saying that people are impersonating other people at the polls and we’ve got to stop it the Republican Lawyers Association was so thoroughly worried about this issue that they have wen and they looked for every single voter fraud case they could find in the last 15 years. They found three hundred and fifty-two cases in the entire country spread across 15 years. All right, I don’t know, do the math up your name is a twenty five cases a year it is a small fraction of the number of reports that we get for UFO sightings coming into the federal government every year. Not only can prosecutors totally handle this crushing caseload of 30 cases spread across the country every year, but based on that logic and we need all these new laws to protect against something that generates about 30 complaints given that there’s about 300 complaints a year for UFOs. 2551- We should be trying to resurrect Orson Welles and prepare to fight the war or worlds let me be clear this attack. These so called voter ID registration D bills may not be that are not all rational response to voter fraud that would be just called prosecution but it is fueled by a very rational- if misguided interest. Those who are seeking to block the vote are absolutely responding to the growing diversity of the American electorate, an electorate that is increasingly more tolerant and less interested in the issues that divide us as a nation and they are attacking voters of color attacking students of all colors the groups that are most seniors are also impacting. Like that grandmother talked about, these are the groups that are most severely impacted exactly because those voters entrance into our society hold the best promise from accelerating us towards the future this is a pattern we have seen every time in the history of this country that the electorate has seen every time in the history of this country. That the electorate has expanded in a significant way the electorate expanded because of the Civil War, the passage of the 13th 14th and 15th amendment and then what happened years of attacks seeking to narrow the vote, the state of New York will fascinating tidbit of history actually opposed the Fifteenth Amendment they’d already given black property owners the right to vote before the civil was and they said want the politics to be changed all blacks voting and so when pushed through one the first ex-felon ban to be passed in the wake of the Civil War they said that they were doing explicitly to achieve a similar counterbalancing of the black vote or similar suppression on the blackboard to the civil rights movement we saw an expansion in the electorate and we saw the rise of the Southern Strategy and with it very nasty forms of illegal but very effective voter suppression and now following 2008 falling the most diverse in every way president electorate in history what do we see but the resurrection of these old virtues of these old tactics of these old playbooks and we must come together to stamp them out at all costs. No and that’s why I love races so much because we were talking and I said we really need your help and she said don’t worry I’m already making plans on how to get his done, we need leaders like that, leaders of vision, leaders of courage, who understand that the only way that any of us are going to win, if we all dive in and do it together, we’ve already had a major victory. South Carolina DOJ just rejected their voter ID bill and while Nikki Haley is Headed to the Supreme Court trying to get that bill reinstated, and possibly get the Voting Rights Act, at the same time we are cautiously optimistic she will not find the fifth vote that she needs. Nonetheless, we must remain vigilant and focused. Dr. King said that voting is the foundation stone for political action we must do all we can to protect the right to vote because people come after your right to vote. 2959- Quite frankly, to make it easier to go after so many other rights that you may in fact hold more dear, let me be clear the folks who are funding this attack on voting rights are the same folks who are attacked funding. Attacks on environmental protection they’re the same folks who are funding attacks on immagrants rights. They are the same folks who are funding attacks on a woman’s right to chose. They are the same folks who are peeved about affirmative action and would really like to not see something like this gender identity anti discrimination bill passed they are in other words a little upset that today’s America looks more like something approaching a more perfect example of human unity than the world they were born into a long long time ago. But, with the task force and the NAACP and so many of our other sister and brother organizations and the progressive movement coming together very clear that we can never allow ourselves to be discouraged, distracted or divided id something is critical as the vote for children’s lives or a community’s financial strength at stake. We are on a good path, and we have to stay on this path because history has taught us that we can never win the battle for justice, equality and freedom. When out soldiers are defined and limited by individual silos that we can only emerge victorious. When we unite for the common goof, for all we emerge victorious so let us move forward in unity with the collective vision and determination required to build the America that we dream for all of her children. An America where everyone can get a good job. An America where everyone can get a good job. An America where everyone can obtain a quality education. An America where everyone has access to health care and communities with clean air and clean water and stay with their loved one at the hospital. An America in which opportunities are afforded to all and most importantly an America in which no matter a person’s race sexual orientation or gender she or he can live in a country free of discrimination hatred and violence. A nation where all of our basic human rights basic dignities are respected as I close and prepare to take my seat let us all recall the words of the late great California statesman and visionary Harvey Milk it takes no compromising to give people their rights it takes you no money to respect the individual it takes no survey to remove repression thank you task force for being the task force that we at the NAACP, depends on me to make sure the NAACP is there for you, thank you and God bless.

  transcript: 0004- it’s good to be here at Netroots, here to say that whether it is fighting HB 6, HB 56 in Alabama or it’s finding that anti birth control bill they call personhood in Mississippi or fighting for marriage equality and it would have outlawed birth control too. We’re fighting for marriage equality in North Carolina and across this country the NAACP is committed to being a good ally and I’m here to say thank you to all of you who spoke for Troy Davis, who spoke out about the injustice in Georgia together we made the hashtag too much doubt the number one social issue tweeted about in 2011. The second thing only to Beyoncé’s pregnancy, but because of that, because of that out reach, because of that engagement, because Russell Simmons was tweeting about it and all y’all were tweeting about it and even Kim Kardashian was tweeting about it. People in this county had to think about the death penalty and you know what happened? Public support for the death penalty has fallen as a result to its lowest level since it was abolished in 1972 and as a result we just abolish it several weeks ago in Connecticut and things go right this fall will abolish it in California and next year we’ll do it in the great state, oh, the great state od Maryland where I live what that mean y’all is that we are actually within sight of abolishing it all together in our country. We all we got to get to 26 states and we are at 17 now headed towards 19 and its because of the activism, of people in this room thank you but if we had hoped that maybe we were in the early days of a post racial nation from Troy Davis to hate crimes in Tulsa Oklahoma to Trayvon Martin. We understand that we are not there yet. I believe that day may come one day but a fear wont be any day too soon. Right now, we are building and rebuilding if we’re honest a massive campaign to end racial profiling in this country. I say rebuilding because if you think back more than a decade even George W Bush was campaigning against racial profiling in 1999 my children don’t remember that in fact our children haven’t even heard us talk really as a country about racial profiling until the past few months and so we have to keep that conversation going and we need all of you involved in it we all of us involved in it. If racial profiling could be ended by the NAACP trust me we would have done it a long time ago it can be ended by this country and we’re an import part of it but its going to take all of us doing it if you’ll bear with me I want to reflect a moment I want to offer some reflections about what’s been on my mind is we’ve been traveling from Trayvon Martin rally to Trayvon Martin rally across this country waking up this nation and giving voice to a generation that has seen racial profiling go through the roots as they’ve grown up and yet heard very little discussion of it. I you look at these young people, think about how they start their day each morning at school reciting together one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. I’ll remind us of that pledge for three reasons, the first is that the simplest most succinctly social contract that blinds us as a nation. 0457- It is literally the simplest representation of the collective aspirations of the progressive movement for generations in this country and at the center of its is the notion of justice with liberty property rights for all democratic rights, justice, civil rights, right in the middle of that trilogy. Justice is the first purpose of our Constitution. Justice is the first ambition of the great revolution that gave birth to this country. I’m talking about the first Tea Party, talking about Bunker Hill, talking about the Boston Massacre that gave us our first Trayvon Martin. Crispus Atticus. There was a time when the entire country was outrages about police brutality but it was a long time ago. The third reason that I mentioned, the pledge is because for our youngest children like my daughter who’s 6 years old like we were decades ago. That pledge isn’t just some secular prayer that they recite every day its actually where they think they live under one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. If we have a duty as citizens as parent’s it is to ensure that social contract is enforce- it is to ensure that our nation actually achieves. It’s aspirations of being as Frederick Douglass said over a hundred something years ago in his street against the Chinese Exclusion Act the HP 56 of his day--that our destiny as a nation is to be the most perfect example of human unity of the world has ever seen it is our duty in other words to build a nation that empowers our children towards their dreams more and more the older they get. And not one that reveals its own hypocrisy and breaks out hearts more and more the older they get in cities like New York City I want to talk about to stop and frisk program for a minute and Mayor Bloomberg cities like New York City. Literally, children say that pledge in the morning- one nation, liberty and justice for all of us and then they walk out the school door or even through their school hallway and they are suspected and mistreated, thrown up against the wall, hand shocked in their pockets sometimes sexually assaulted because of their color not their character. Raise your hand if you remember the Amadou Diallo case that year. We though that New York City’s notorious Street Crimes Unite was out of control because NYPD did 80,000 stop and frisk that year and about ninety percent of the people of color and about ninety percent of them didn’t even have a gun and yet they were treated like they were criminals and a hundred percent of them felt humiliated most of those innocent people and we said well. 0854- Giuliani’s only 80,000 these it’s out of of control, this year Mayor Bloomberg is on pace to do 800,000. Last year he did 685,000. How many guns did he get? This Mayor who is so on fire, he right about stand your ground, he’s right about that. He is wrong about stop and fix how many guns did he get for the 6865,000 stops 760. 760. How many hundreds of thousands of young people have had their self-image assaulted and their hearts broken or pushed into depression because they were jacked up and treated like a criminal because of the color – walking down the street we will never know. But we do know that in New York City last year there were more stops and frisks of black men between the ages of 14 and 24 then there are black boys and men between the ages of 14 and 24 in the entire city the lie that he tells us again and again is that we have to do this because it makes us safer. He’s very proud that New York City has lowered violent crime by 29 percent in the past 10 years. What he doesn’t want you to know is that in the same period, without using this aggressive form of street level racial profiling and targeting of young people because of their color, Los Angeles has lowered violent crime by 59 percent, New Orleans by 56 percent, Dallas by 49 percent, Columbia South Carolina by 45 percent, Baltimore about 37 percent which begs the question, Mayor Bloomberg, why aren’t you doing with their Jordan focusing on fighting crime rather than jacking up our kids now the danger of that argument is that it will live well so some people into accepting the oppression of our young people accepting a police state and what the real tea party understood back in 1776 is that people who as soon as they had oppressed people as soon as they accept their own oppression. Their oppression becomes permanent what Jack Kemp understood when he and I were in Los Angeles over ten years ago dealing with the I think that the 10th anniversary of the riots after Rodney King was that all these children who are being mistreated are all our children we were standing in South LA. That’s right and I offer camp because he was a Republican and many people here, I understand are not Republicans. But Jack was standing there and his shirt sleeves rolled up and he was on fire and he was talking about our kids. Our kids and this black woman standing next to me looked at him, looked at me, looked at him, she leans over to me and said ‘um he’s not from here is he’ I said no ma’am that’s Jack he once ran for president, that’s maybe where you saw him. He said no no no no no yeah I know who he is but I mean whose kids is he talking about, he’s in for South LA and I said ma’am I understand what you say I think is pulling is that they are all our kids because we are all citizens of this country and we all have a responsibility to ensure they are treated with dignity and have a great future and that’s why I was so proud to stand with leaders. 12;53- The LGBT community of the Stonewall Inn last week with 35 LGBT organizations and now is that they will be with us on father’s day when we match to Mr. Bloomberg’s house calling for an end to stop and frisk and so I’m going to ask folks to get ready to stand up here for a second. A man asked them to stand up, stand up if you have ever been racially profiled. Please join me in standing up because I’ve been racially profiled. Stand up id somebody you love- a friend, child, has been racially profiled stand up if you’re worried about somebody in your life being racially profiled look at these folks if you’re not standing up and ask yourself are you willing to stand up for them with them for their children please stand up by standing together. Standing up together against assault on a woman’s right to choose gets assault on our environment because its assault on worker’s rights and standing up together against the American original sin of racism and racial profiling and all the other lies that it spawns. That is the way that we will hasten the future together that is the way that we will make a better America for all our children because they are all our children and that is how we will make this country finally and forever one nation under god indivisible with liberty and justice for all, thank you and God Bless.

  transcript: 0028 Jealous- to quote him is to pull this country back together to deal with this country as it is and we are very clear at doing that. We have a zero tolerance policy for racial discrimination no matter who does it and we believe that civil rights …(Anderson interrupts)... we saw a statement that we believed was a condense version of the truth, that was shorter than the actual statement but true. We responded quickly because as we do in this line of work where we’re called to respond to video evidence all the time, make very quick judgments, we made a quick set of calls it was late at night as you may recall our statement came out at one am that we were dealing with this, we woke up some people in Georgia, we tried to figure what was going on, we looked at it and we said you know what there is just no way to condone this, what we didn’t realize is that it had been spliced and diced six ways from Sunday so as to completely hide this beautiful story of transformation that you will see if you go to our website and you look at the full video.  0158 Jealous- you know if they had said the things that they said at any NAACP event we would have we are very sensitive to people saying that something was done wrong at one of our events we have hundreds of these dinners across the country put on by volunteers and tore one I travel to dozens of them each year they are beautiful events this one was a beautiful transformational moment of someone telling a story that the country needs to hear. 0231- Jealous you know, take the tea party for instance we studied them for months before we saying something we looked into them very seriously we are dealing with them because forty percent of the country says that or at least recently 40 percent of the country said that they sympathize with them 17 percent said that they actively support them and they are an insurgent right wing populous movement with far right extremists, um parts of it that we haven’t seen in a very long time and yet they have a terrific opportunity to lead this country to a better place as far as conservative politics if they could just get those extremists out like they have started to do so you know that is very serious and methodical, now you take a group like the new black panther the people from the Southern County Law center have spoke on, look they are a hate group they have been very clear about that everything that they say suggests that is all they are they are extremely tiny and they have not spoken at our events and they have not said these horrible things if they did we would certainly be out there I have been very clear bout condemning that one of the things that Mr. Brightbard does is that they don’t really have a relationship with the truth center that we have gone through the past few weeks I have condemned the new black panther party multiple times I will do it here tonight the things that they have said about killing cracker babies and stuff are horrible are horrible. 422- Jealous yeah the- look, call and response is apart of our culture and so is testifying and witnessing and what clear when you look at the whole video which you can see at NAACP.org is that somebody has stood up to testify about you know when they almost went the wrong way and they almost went the wrong way and they decided to go the right way and the audience was following that story from beginning to end. You see very quickly she talks about how she actually helped them we hear her talking today about how she saved the family farm that’s what this story was about, and they knew when this woman got up to talk in the style that she was talking was telling a story about how she almost wen the wrong way but she ended up going the right way we hear that story frequently in church. 0529- Yes this is the full tape, we had to ftp it today we spent hours with it there may be some tech glitch in there we will receive the hard tape in the morning and we will upload again from that

  transcript: 0002 to 0122- Parents who agree that they can identify with the Trayvon Martin Case and because they have their own unresolved cases if we know that we can bring those stories to the department of justice who will hopefully take the same action here that they have taken in New Orleans. Yes we have a terrible case here and we need to deal with that but we have a terrible pattern of and abuse and discrimination that we are going to deal with all together,  its hard people of all colors will see pictures of Trayvon Martin and not just see a kid who reminds us of some kid in the ghetto, its also about history of this community too many cases, you heard the person say last night you kill a dog you go to jail well a young man was killed and no one is in jail, now its handed over to the state’s attorney and be handled by a grand jury sometime next month frankly I cant imagine being a parent having my child killed having a police chief behave like this police chief, and be able ot keep my faith in them. 0301- see this is a tense situation but it is also a remarkably strong community, that has been able to live with this tension for a month, people now know that the DOJ is opening an investigation, people now know the date of when the grand jury will begin their deliberation, and so that gives people a reason to have faith and come to a close, they need to hold on for a month more, have faith. When you read that law it is hard to come to any conclusions, except the fact that Trayvon Martin had the right in this state to kill Mr. Zimmerman, and was following him and attacking him with a gun in him and threatening him and ultimately using legal force, what that law says if someone stalks you if someone attacks you if someone tries to kill you then you can respond with equal and opposite force everything we hear on that tape is this young man walking away, when someone is walking away from you and you hear the police telling Mr. Zimmerman to disengage you don’t need to follow him, and so our concerned here is that the department fears at every turn to take Mr. Zimmerman’s word- (cuts off mid sentence)

  transcript: 0108 Interviewer- do you think the DNC is the reason Hillary Clinton Lost the election? 0112 to 0141- Jealous Well I guess what it says to me is that frankly all of us as Dems these days want to see our party stronger now that we’ve got to rebuild and frankly mist every building starts in our states in a weave we’ve lost ground states across the country and we’ve got to regain it, that means bringing in young people and that means more of us stepping up to run and so that why I’m doing that um yeah 0208 to 247- Jealous Look, I think its reasonable for somebody in her shoes to still be processing what happened I know many people in this country are, for the rest of us we’ve just got to get back to pushing forward frankly we have to be prepared to push forward no matter what’s coming out of Washington, what comes out of Washington these days you know is often just kind of bonkers, you know, and in the meantime we have children to raise, we have small businesses to build and we’ve got to get back just pushing out lives forward in our state’s other place to do that our cities our counties we really cant count on Congress right now or the Supreme court and we certainly cant count, you cant count on the White House. I mean, from day to day, it’s just a crazy story. 0301 to 0340- Jealous You know, look we have a bunch of great options and I think that Joe and Bernie are out there proving that your 70s are the new 60s, that’s hopeful for guys like me in our 40s, I don’t want to feel like we’re getting too old too fast so you know what am I going to say, anything about Joe this time, Joe’s a good man he’s wanted for a long time and if he wants to get out there that’s great and it means that folks will you know have a harder time saying that Bernie is too old so I think that’s a good thing. 0351 to 0533- Jealous So look my life has been grounded as a community organizer as a civil rights leader as somebody who spent their life living in communities working in communities with people on their own terms to figure out the big solutions to help move all of us forward and I’ve done that in my state. Again, I left the effort there to abolish the death penalty and I helped lead the efforts to pass marriage equality and to pass the DREAM act and touring across the state jus driving around in my truck with my kids sitting down with folks at their kitchen tables, what you heard you know again and again is we just want o move forward, in this you know the President’s tweets and all this craziness in Russia, you know what can we do right here and I see an opportunity in Maryland right now for us to move forward quickly on the economy on education and our kids need us to do just that so that’s why I’ve jumped in I guess the organizer in men the leader in me looks at what’s happening in Washington looks at how silent our governor is, you know, this Republican who on the one hand stood up and said no he was not going to vote for Donald Trump but now the Trump’s in office, he consistently has stayed silent as the Trump Administration slashes the Chesapeake Bay restoration plan, stayed silent you know or even worse, tours with Betsey DeVos and says that he’s going to shift money from our you know from our- shift money that should have gone to our public schools and use it instead to fund private vouchers I mean that’s not what the people of Maryland want, we want to get back to moving our state forward and that’s why I’ve decided to run for governor. 0628 to 0809- Jealous Well look just you know it reminds us of what so many black athletes have said over the years but here in Maryland it brings us right back to just a week and a half ago we had a young man just commissioned as a second lieutenant a US army student at Bowie State two days from graduation over celebrating with his friends at University of Maryland College Park stabbed to death by a white student at the University of Maryland who was part of a Facebook group called Alt Reich and appeared to be motivated by the hate, it’s the second incident like that in the last six months with a young white man from Maryland associated with hate groups stabbing a black man to death and the reality is that race in our county continues you now to be this lightening rod but for us as black men to just leave you know frankly having to fear too much and what we end up doing is just pushing forward but when you are raising children and you have nephews and you have sons, as I do, living with you at home um you know every now and then you just look at them and you say you know we’ve got to find a way to do better and that’s what we really need. Quite frankly is we need leaders who are prepared to pull us together across racial lines to have grown up conversations about race and to take the hate in our schools and with our young people seriously right now we’ve got a president who enflames that every day and that’s why we need more leaders in our country who are willing to step forward at least at the local and state level and try to turn things in the right direction again that’s one of the reasons why I’ve thrown my hat in the ring and decided to run for governor.

  transcript: 0028 to 0234- Jealous My name is Ben Jealous, I’m the former national president of the NAACP, I am running for governor because Maryland’s been good to my family and I want to make sure that our state is good to working families for generations to come. My family moved here almost eighty years ago from southern Virginia, granddad to work the B&O railroad, grandma to work for Planned Parenthood in 1941 they moved into the housing projects of West Baltimore and well a generation later they were at the Dulles Airport waving goodbye to me as I flew off to be a Rhodes Scholar thank you, my public school teachers are still wondering how that happened and what I’ll tell you is this- I can’t explain I mean we’ve lived that dream that Maryland dream that’s a littlie easier that the American dream is in other places because our states always been a little better but I cant explain it, without schools that were always strong and getting stronger, not weaker, and with great public education all the way through you know what made it possible to ultimately go from answering phones at planned parenthood or being a dishwasher on the railroad to being respectively a social worker and a probation officer, was that Maryland paid for their public higher education at a time before mass incarceration when our public hydration with out public higher education was free or almost free and so you can count on me as somebody whose family has benefitted immensely from our public school system all the way through to fight to make sure that we in these days where we under incest our educators and we under invest in our university students and we drive them into debt , we will end both of those when I am governor. 0254 to 0528– Jealous This struggle for me is personal, I have two kids in the public school  in our state and while my mom sued Western High School for girls in Baltimore when she was 12 so she could desegregate it in 1955 when she was 15 and what families who were involved in that but a gay should know is that our lawyers who ultimately guided by Thurgood Marshall understood that unless we were willing to also have funding equity we could never win and so I’m running for governor to finish what my mama helped a start and to make sure that our schools are well funded, that every school is a great school and that every child gets a great education and what does that mean that means that first of all we got to keep out promise on the casino money and the lottery money and we have to use that funding. See when you look at the so called racial achievement gap which is really if we’re on as part of a much bigger class based achievement gap what you will see in West Baltimore you’ll see in Cumberland, you’ll see in Salisbury its not always black and brown kids, there are a lot of poor white kids who are getting undereducated- is that the number one way to close that gap is to invest in having a great teacher  in every classroom, great educators in every school and if you’re going to have great educators in every school they you’ve got to be willing to pay a competitive wage and if you’re going to  do that then you have to have the courage on the budget to push first things first and yes if we’re under educating our schools by a sum of money that amounts to- sorry if we’re underfunding our schools by somewhat amounts to 5% of our overall budget that we have to figures out how to better manage our overall budget, to find that 5% because we are also going to need to make sure our kids grow up to kindergarten ready to learn that means a full day universal pre-k and ideally universal pre-k it means learning from other cities and other states and other countries where they’re investing in parent educators to help parents prepare young children, he’s investing in our home-based daycare providers but it also means having a different vision for how we educate for the trade so we’re preparing children to be career ready which maybe that you’re halfway through an apprenticeship to become a plumber. 0607 to 0641- Jealous We need to recognize that the underperformance of the American education system is fundamentally about our failure to support our low income children. Singapore leads the world in k-12 educational outcomes because the gap between their poor children and their rich children is four times smaller than it is in our country, if we’re going to push our country back to first it means we have to lift all of our children up. 0657 to 0711– Jealous My proudest accomplishment is having been the youngest NAACP president in the history and as the chronicle of philanthropy said on the front page when I stepped down Jealous leaves NAACP far stronger place. 0721 to 0747–Jealous Doug Wilder… you now if Virginia built a campaign of working families to break the color barrier at their state capital like 30 years ago I think maybe we should try to catch up. 0753 to 0845– Jealous I learned that those voters who voted Obama-Obama-Trump, who tended to be white and working class and those voters who voted Obama-Obama and didn’t vote tended to be black and brown and working class. Each felt betrayed on the economy. As Democrats, if we’re going to get back to winning we have to get back to being democrats and that means that we have to have the courage to stand up to Wall Street and to Big Pharma and say that yes we ate the party to advance civil rights and we are the party to expand economic opportunity but we are also the party, the party that will end poverty in our country. 0850 to 0900– Jealous The last book I read was ‘Young Men and Fire’ by Norman MacLean its about the first group of smoke jumpers who have an elite group of forest fire fighters. 0911- QUESTION If you could only pick one thing, what would you most like to reverse that governor Hogan has done in the last three years. 0915 to 1044 - Jealous Oh geez, you know if its one thing its him being governor and I got 53 more seconds left so let me tell you how were going to do that- I’ve been endorsed by SEIU and the Communication workers and the postal workers, the nurses, friends of the earth, Bill McKibben, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker- Bernie Sanders and Cory Booker. Think about that we’re going to build a movement of working families across the sate and we’re going to turnout Democrats by being Democrats on the only candidate Larry Hogan has made sure that the National Republican Governors Association attack pretty much weekly the last few months end its because he knows that we built a team to turnout voters and he’s only in office because voters didn’t turn out when I was president of the NAACP, Van Jones on CNN called the NAACP under my leadership the unsung hero’s of Obama’s reelection because we turned out 1.4 million voters, we will beat him doing just that and will wall up and turn unlikely voters thank you and god bless.

  transcript: 0014 to 0133- Jealous We chose my cousin’s flower shop Baltimore Blossoms, it’s a great name we started just after the uprisings and it speaks to the yearnings and the front of the power of the people of Baltimore in people of our great state to move our state forward no matter what else is happening and that what we need to be doing right now you know, we’ve of course, have to resist Trump in his horrible policies but we also have to get ready to move beyond resistance to actually move our cities and our counties and our states forward no matter what’s happening in Washington and moving beyond resistance what does that look like to you means frankly seizing the power that we have know we as progressives for generations now have mourned the transfer of power from our federal government to our state governments but in this moment when extreme right-wingers control every branch of our federal government it is time for us to embrace what is and use the power in our states for good, to move out children’s opportunities forward to move our state forward out families make it possible to actually put a high quality teacher in every classroom where the whole police officers who have killed unarmed civilians accountable or to ensure that everybody here has access to health care. 0148 to 0231– Jealous You know, the reality is that everybody who’s working needs the same thing right you need a dependable schedule, you need a fair wage, and you need to know that when you’re sick you can take care of yourself. You need to have health care. Our governor had an opportunity to stand up for working people and he sat down instead … at least five days, I think most folks would say they need at least two weeks the reality is that you can’t get sick and your child can’t get sick and no worker should fear losing a job because they need to stay home to take care of a sick kid or frankly not you say able to take care of themselves so they don’t go to work and spread that virus to somebody else. 0243 to 0328– Jealous Right now, we have an opportunity to ensure that work pays again in our state that every parent an go to bed at night knowing that just working a 40-hour week is enough to cover the basement the basic necessities for their family the reality is that nobody wants a minimum job more, you want a minimum house or a minimum car um but we’ve got to set up floor somewhere and the reality is that the minimum wage had kept up with inflation it’d be at $15 it keep up with productivity it’d be at $19 seems to me like $15 is a reasonable place to start so lets go ahead and make that happen for working families across our state. 0354 to 0524– Jealous I’m a proud progressive whose entire career has been grounded in my years as a community organizer and as a civil rights leader I have  track record of standing up despite the odds despite the heat to do the right thing id that here when I led the state, built a movement here that succeeded in abolishing the death penalty did that again in the same year here when it was time to actually help pull in black leadership to pass marriage equality, did it again that same year when it was time to again pull in leadership across the state to pass the DREAM act and I’m sure I’ve gone to jail for protesting more than anybody else who’s running for governor across the country but the reality is that you know CAP is supposed to be a nonprofit organization so I’m not sure when my colleagues there if they felt betrayed felt betrayed arm by me standing up with Bernie, I’m a progressive and I stood up with a very proudly progressive candidate to push for the sorts of policies that we talked about, his CAP as fellows so you know its, um, this is all you can do was run it as yourself and fro my entire life on the children of organizers when I was 18 and I’m going to run like the proud progressive community organizer that I am. 0540 to 0706 –Jealous Leaders across the state right now are on a journey trying to figure out what is going on that we’ve had two young white men stabbed black men to death apparently just because of their race just in the past six months one from Towson and went up to New York City pulled out a sword and killed a black man, one in college park pulled out a long knife killed fellow student, took story of Cain and Abel, I commend all of those you have dug down deep and ask the question what more what more, what more can we do so loving a lot of good first steps we’re going to stay on that journey that inspires me most I was at his memorial at Bowie State, I was at his funeral, the resilience of his family and the commitment of his friends and his classmates at Bowie State and at College Park, young people coming together across lines of race and religion to say we’re going to move forward together, we’re going to create the world that’s destined to create a more inclusive vibrant productive place we’re not going to fall victim to the hate and that’s frankly where I put my hope. I put my hope with your generation, I put my hope with the young people rising up in this state for home frankly the history of division oppression matters less in shaping how they complete their own lives. 0724 to 0817- Jealous My grandma is a hundred years old. She started her career working for Planned Parenthood in Baltimore in 1940. My father has always been supportive and raised me to be the same way of a woman’s right to choose and to control her own destiny and to know as well as the struggle to ensure that everybody who need quality health care gets access to it, my parents its rights at the juncture of both of those movements, of both of those needs, we must as a state in this moment be prepared to provide quality affordable health care to everybody in Maryland no matter what happens in Washington, and I commend my colleagues frankly the Democrats at the State Capitol for the leadership they’ve shown on this issue. 0837 to 1034– Jealous I mean I’m a visiting professor so my power on the matter is limited I’ve been very supportive of my students both publicly and privately in their quest to get the name removed he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan and I um you know agree with folks who say you know generally like when buildings are named a long time ago we should respect the history there are exceptions for I mean how do you how do you heal with being at that school then on the same way I think that anybody I mean you know the reality with what college get out you go to I went to Bard College have you dug into the history of the northeastern liberal arts schools and where their money came from shit you know the reality is I went to Columbia University I’m a Rhodes Scholar, you look at Brown University it feels like its miles away from slavery yet it was funded by (interrupted by interviewer) I’m at the, my school teaching young people to today one of the few schools in the Ivy League where students are accumulating no debt and the reality is is that in our society the way that we change things is that we engage that we get involved that we add our voiced that we add our support and we keep pushing now when I was a student at Columbia, in getting a center to teach about the history of people of color in this country, to actually include us into the curriculum and ethnic studies department, we fought that fight for 25 years, if you give up and you walk away the great victories don’t happen so you know that’s how you change things is you dig in and you fight that’s what my life has been as an organizer and you know and that’s what we as progressives are when we’re at our best if you just sort of tuck tail and walk away nothing changes.

  transcript: 0516- Thank you, I am proud to accept this on behalf of the NAACP, on behalf of our 1200 volunteer led active units across this nation and on behalf of our 64 person board who overwhelmingly voted to support marriage equality including our chairman Rossland Rock and out past chairman Julian Bond, I’m proud this evening to be joined by leaders on our national staff and the leader of the Maryland NAACP Gerald Stansberry, like his peers in Maine Minnesota and Washington State, Gerald is on the front line fighting for marriage equality every single day, Especially proud to be here with my night with my wife Leah tonight this is our first date since our son was born on the fourth of July. Sitting at our table is civil rights legends I say this man has a civil rights legend I say this man is a civil rights legend, let me make this clear, he was the organizer in Memphis leading the sanitation workers when Dr. King was killed. Bill Lucy, Bill Lucy who 30 years ago stood up at a tough and contentious Union convention and said that the fight for LGBT rights and the fight against racism were on of the same. In the more than four years I’ve been president of the NAACP, I have made it very clear that in order to have friends you got to be a friend, because as Dr. King once said to a teacher of mine if you’re comfortable in you coalition, your coalition is too small, our society must realize the promise that our school children recite back to us everyday when they say our great pledge, we must truly become one nation under God with liberty and justice for all that pledge is what we aspire to as an ideal but is not the lived experience of millions upon millions in this country and it must be, we owe it to our children for when they say that pledge is my 6 year old daughter does every day they don’t think that’s where they may live right now and I’m not going to disappoint her in order for us to become one nation all of the leaders in this room and we are all in one way leaders, all of us in this room, we must act as if we are one nation already so tis with pride that I ask you to join me and the rallying cry of the NAACP I think you’ve heard our president say this once or twice, fired up ready to go fired up far enough as a great American family, whether we were born here whether our family sacrificed everything to be here what binds us together is our commitment to persevere in the face of great odds not 22 not to just secure our individual families but that of our neighbors to as American parents, we believe nothing more fervently then that every generation must be better off and more open minded than the last as an American people we celebrate the many times that our nation has lead this world away from hate and ever towards hope and so in this precipitous moment when we as a movement or on the brink of massive change and tremendous progress when here we are, less than 50 years removed from when my parents own marriage was illegal in our home state of Maryland, when here we are finally at a place where we can be confident that the day will come, when marriage equality will be the law of the land in every single state let us stand up for marriage equality from coast to coast and border to border, let us stand together against racism as HRC did. When you joined us at the Stonewall Inn last March to declare our joint opposition to racial profiling in New York City and let us stick and let us keep on standing up together until this great country finally becomes as out school children pray for it to be every single day one nation under God with liberty and justice for all, thank you and God bless.

  transcript: 0018- Thank you, whenever I can walk out of Low Library and not be let out in handcuffs it’s a good day, it is quite an honor to be here with you, class on 2010, with your Dean’ and professors so many of New York’s finest, so I got to know well while I was here at college, as you step out of here today you will define your legacy and that of our country. These are days when we each are called to be clear about what we want not just from our lives but for this world these days of Dickensian contradiction walk into the department of justice and you will be greeted by photos of two men both graduates of this college, beneath their names you will see the words President and Attorney General, a few weeks ago if you walked into a field north of here in upstate New York you would have seen pictures of these same two men held above the heads of angry protesters with the words scrolled beneath their pictures saying Lynch Eric Holder, Lynch President Obama. These men, these women fantasize about taking us back to the 18th century and they distort what our founding fathers and mothers hoped for all of us lets party like its 1776 says Sara Palin as if the 18th century was good for any of us I mean sure rich white men could vote but their life expectancy was about 38 and in the wake that she and others leave as they crisscross across this country, the governor of Arizona has just penned a law that greatly empowers the ability of your local police department in Phoenix or Tucson to put you in jail if you don’t have your papers on you and they think you look or you sound like you might be foreign, I will leave here this afternoon and walk over to a press conference we will announce that we’re filing a lawsuit with the ACLU to invalidate that law and this Wednesday I’;; be in Texas where former secretary of education Rodney Page and I will be taking on the governor and his school board who want to change the way that the children across the south are taught to minimize what they learned about Thomas Jefferson, to minimize the very work of the word democracy to maximize the portrayal of the Confederacy and to defend Senator Joe McCarthy- I say to you class of 2010, lets party like its 2010, lets party like ours is the nation that brought the world the 21st century and yours is the generation that will define it and now is the time for you to declare that we will move this country ever forward and never backward now is the time 0429- for all of us who believe in the greatness of this country to stand up now is the time for all of us who would rather build this country up and out of this recession than tear it apart and leave it in, now this is the time for all of us who believe in hope not hate to speak up and be heard because change is what happens each and every day not just what happens on Election Day. If you’ve learned anything while at the college in this city you have learned how to listen to people who do not look like you, do not sound like you, did not grow up where you grew up, this is the most valuable thing you can carry out into this world the first time I left this campus I was involuntarily and blessed with some refunded financial aid dollars with loans bought a jeep and I headed down to Mississippi where the governor was seeking to shut down a historically black university, and turn it into a prison sort of like the school to a prison pipeline, no pipeline school, the prison, then we showed up just after Byron de la Beckwith who had been put in prison thirty years too late for having killed NAACP leader Medgar Evers and we announced that we would have a big protest to show the world at Mississippi that Mississippians did not believe in turning colleges into prisons. The Klan put out a press release I kid you not they apparently have a press secretary, the Klan put out a press release saying that they would kill one or all four leaders of the protest and I was one of those, and we decided that it was important that this protest not just  have black Mississippians and it also have white Mississippians because you can walk around to hear murmurs and know that there were lots of people who disagreed with the governor’s plan, but given the charge to find white liberals in Mississippi in 1994, we figured Earth’s day was the best place to look for him. And so we sent out teams of student organizers to all of the historically white campuses and sadly Mississippi, that’s the history, you only have white colleges and historically black colleges and by six o’clock all of them had been checked expect one, and by midnight I fell asleep at my desk. I know you all can’t recall this but there was a day before cell phones I fell asleep at my desk waiting for them to call in and at 2am the phone rang and they said that we’re okay but we had a bad situation of its state  0719- Mississippi State we need you to get down to the Waffle House right away, well like any you know college jock you couldn’t keep me away from Waffle House, so I hopped in my car and I ran down, there we huddled around the table and they explained that the students wouldn’t let them speak until the end did they mean the very end after it turned into a keg party in the third encore Sweet Home Alabama, it’s a great song, they were led up to speak and they chanted save the black colleges and the crowd roared back get a rope and here in the Pawnee woods in Mississippi north of Philadelphia where new  Yorkers Chaney and Goodman and Schwerner and Mississippian Chaney were ordered to their death by the local sheriff they ran to their cars and they did that little Mississippi two-step where you drive just fast enough to get the heck our of town and just slow enough that the sheriff wont notice you, and we were huddled around this table in this Waffle House and there was a man staring at us, an old white man who had gold rings on every finger and a baggy shirt in a state where for a hundred bucks and no felonies you could carry a firearm wherever you want to go and he kept staring at us real hard and we noticed in that instant that his shirt was baggy and a hunk below his pant line and we were the only black folks in the restaurant and it was 3 am at this point, we had ben there debating and discussing and he walked over to our table carrying two large bags and he looked at us real intently and said are you the boys I’ve been seeing on television now is from California by the way of New York and one guy was from Saint Louis another was from New Orleans and a third one was from Chicago, the four of us in other words were not accustomed to anybody calling us a boy who wasn’t our boy and let alone some old due at 3 o’clock in the morning, looked at us like he might want to kill us but we were the only black folks in the restaurant the Klan to put out a press release and we so we just looked at him and said yes sir, he said hold on a second, and he turned around to put down his to go order and his dominant hand was hidden and two of the organizers were football players and they were getting ready to jump him because they were convinced that he was going to swing around and shoot us and I said hold up lets just listen to what he has to say, and they gave me this look like then we might be dead by the time he says it, and I just said hold up hear what he has to say, and he spun around and extended his hand he said well I just want to shake your hand because if I’d been born an n-word in this crazy state I’d be mad as heck- I won the used car lot right down highway 49 explain the gold rings if you need anything if you need money if you need a car you just come and see me and know that I’m always on your side, the next morning I sent the organizers down there to get 100 bucks from him because I was getting paid 85 bucks a week and I needed to get paid and they needed their faith in humanity restored, because the day before we had made a critical mistake- we assumed that we knew who our allies were and we assumed that we knew our ally who our ally certainly wasn’t, and one got us a death threat to our face from an angry 1117- crows and the other got us an open hand from a man who we assumed to give us nothing but grief that is the courage that going to school in New York City teaches you that is the gift that you bring from here out into the world, in these times when we see the graduates of this college as heroes and angry mobs see them as boys to be lynched let us all be clear that we are the change this country needs you are the ones who will make sure that it happens and most importantly when faced with that moment of choice, always go with your gut it always pays off in the very end thank you and god bless

  transcript: 0043 to 0156; Jealous- Bernie Sanders and I agree on a lot, we have an opportunity here to actually help the voters see that they agree with each other on a lot and to go get it done and that’s why I’m good you know that’s why I intend to be the next governor from the state, one of the mistakes that we make in this country is that we don’t talk about the ways that everybody suffer and so we’ll talk about the homicide rate for black men under 30 but we don’t talk about the suicide rate for men over 55, we’ll talk about the fact we have most economy black and brown people on the planet without mentioned, we also have the most incarcerated white people on the planet and what they all have in common is that about 90% couldn’t afford their own lawyer, Bernie and I have been organizers since we were young and the first thing that you’re taught is that you did not elect politicians to make change happen, no you meant you elect politicians to make it a little easier for you to make change happen for the people to make change happen for a movement to make change happen and what Ben Jealous is about has a radical idea that maybe government should represent all of the people and not just the 1%. 0209 to 0305 Jealous- I’ve made a dozen trips to the worst parts of the state already and what I find is that when folks listen and when I listen to them when we talk with each other we discovered that we have far more in common than we don’t, why was a backyard on the Eastern Shore in a rural area, the Trump voter asked me if I supported single payer and I said eyes and he said well then ill vote for you and ill organize other trump voters to vote for you and I said why and he said because I’m a finance manager at a car dealership and every year I’d read the same days, the say that we find out how much more than we expected our health insurance is going up again this year you say and then I have to have two conversations I hate to have one is with the owner of the dealership to explain to him that once again we’re going to revise down our profit projections because our health care they eat up more but then we expected and the other is with our employees we pause at whom I love to tell them once again when it comes to health care they’re going to pay more and get less. 0347 to 0430 Jealous- I’m running as Ben Jealous, I’m running as a guy who has been a civil rights organizers entire life, he’s run advocacy non profits to help folks make sure that their voices were heard and somebody who co-chaired Bernie sanders campaign here in the state, was one of his national surrogates and the reality is that the people of this state know that is my name on the ballot and they want to know who I am and I’m fortunate to have a long track record its very clear that I am somebody who fights for people who unites people across lines and who frankly only knows how to how to run one way, I got size fourteen feet, I cant be switching up positions you know I got it just got to run in one two correction and that direction is always towards the people trying to figure how we build real solutions. 0446 to 0506 Jealous- I have planted my size fourteen feet right here in the state that my family’s been rooted in for almost 8- years and I’m fighting to make sure the working families of the state get a better deal and we will surprise people and our ability to unite people across every line they say suppose to keep up apart, we’ll find that across those lines we’ll build bridges that will bring us all together.
