  transcript: It gives me great pleasure to introduce Mr. Benjamin Todd Jealous president. (Jealous)Well, good morning, no, it is, uh, thank you for that, for that.  Welcome and as somebody's parents met as teachers at Harlem park Junior High School in West Baltimore, it's good to be here.  It's good to be here, you know, and I'm here, as Ms. Johnson said, I'm here as somebody who cut their teeth doing the work that all of us do to make this country better.  Here's somebody who cut their teeth working for Front Lash out of the sub cell of 815 Sixteenth Street, organizing students and union members against NAFTA, and I'm here as somebody who was able to go to college because of his grandparents were union members, and what this life of being raised by people in the struggle to spend your life fighting for justice in this country has taught me is that if we're going to put this country back to work, we have got to pull this country back together.  I want it, I got a question for you. How many of y'all were in Washington on January 20th, 2009 for the inauguration of President Obama, January 21st, and how many of you watched on TV?  Y'all are the smart ones.  It was cold that day.  It was really cold.  You can tell who the Hollywood celebrities were because they had somebody to carry their Ugg boots at the party.  I realized that day, I was, I was sitting there with my NAACP skull cap pulled down over my head about 20 rows behind the president on the platform, watching this great change of power in this country, that I had actually been given the forecast two years earlier by my grandfather like so many other people who believed deeply and in the great cause of working for justice in this country, didn't quite make it to see that great day when the 233 year-old color barrier at the White House was broken, and I said to him in his final year of life, I said yeah Grandy, I think we got a winner, his name is Barack Hussein Obama.  Barack who?  I said, Barack Hussein Obama but me said let, he say he's black, right, and he said, let, 92 years of being a black man in America just help you out on this one, grandson.  It'll be a cold day, and he was exactly right.  We all know if you change the way the wind blows, you make it blow really, really hard, you can bring the temperature all the way down, and that's what that day was about.  People across this country celebrated, because after almost a decade of struggle in this country, we had come together.  We had changed the way that the wind blew, and we finally had it blowing in our direction, and that meant that the day after, while families woke up to a new day with the same old questions, we as organizers woke up and say well we got a lot of hard work to do, and we made a tactical decision where each of us ran out in different directions.  The Latino organization, the Latino groups ran out to pass comprehensive immigration reform. All of us that will support you but take the lead, and the teachers ran out to make sure that we had a stimulus bill, and to make sure that we're investing money in education.  The civil rights community ran out to take care of a whole long agenda that had been almost crushed by the Bush administration, and the faith community ran out to make sure that the poor and the least among us were taken care of as we dipped into a recession, and we've made a lot of progress that way, but in the past 18 months or so, we've also started to feel a little bit hollow, start to feel a little bit weary, start to feel a little bit alone and isolated, and our primary constituencies that we are active in, and on the horizon we start to see the massive backlash that always happens in this country when you make major progress.   We passed the Lilly Ledbetter bill.  They were shocked.  You passed a stimulus bill that allowed us to build up school infrastructure across this country.  We passed health care reform even after they said it was DOA, and each time we've made progress, this group on the horizon, this group of over privileged overeducated, I'm sorry to say that to teachers, but there is such a thing as over educated folks in this country, you know, there's a point when you have so much book sense, I can say this is a Rhodes scholar, but you have completely lost all common sense, but this group of over privileged folks are really part of a dying demographic in this country that call themselves the Tea Party has captivated the national imagination, and that majority that we all led together in 2008 seems to have forgotten that it exists, as if we've gone anywhere except for back to the couch, and our job together between now and November is to get them off the couch, to get our members back into the streets going door-to-door, making the case for justice in this country, reminding people how it is, that we have come to make such great progress in the last 18 months and of the own path, and the power that they own in their own hearts, if they just have faith that more, more progress can be made.  The way that you make the wind blow your way in Washington is you come back together and that's why Randy and I, the leadership of the AFT, the leadership of the NAACP, the leadership of the AFL-CIO, and the leadership of Service Employees Union, to last, the leadership of the civil rights community, the entire leadership conference on civil and human rights it's all 200 organizations and a broad faith-based group of allies are all coming together, called for a massive march on Washington on October 2nd, 2010.  You see in moments like this, you really only got two choices, and you look back at the history of the late 1960s or the history the 1950s 1930's 1870s, and what you see is that whether it's the depression of the 30s, whether it's sort of the end of the ascendant economy of the, of the 50s and 60s that when you get into tough times financially and you're making, still making great progress legislatively, that everybody in this country is called on to go in one of two directions.  Either you tear this country apart, you push it down hill towards division and hatred, or you pull this country together, and you do the hard work of pushing uphill towards hope and progress, and so as these group of folks who drink tea and apparently are very gainfully employed, according to all the polls, say that they're going to take this country back, I suggest we take them very seriously because they will take us right back to the 18th century if we let them, and my white dad would remind my black mama that the 18th century wasn't that good for anybody, because for even land owning white men like him, the life expectancy was about 40.  We have got to reacquaint these tea drinkers with volunteers who drink coffee and we have to do it with great urgency, because we are making progress every day towards getting this country's priorities back in order, but the inertia from the past eight years is so great and from the years of Reaganism and upside down economics for 30 years before that are so great that if we don't pull ourselves back together, push forward with all our might and make sure the economy of this country works for all of us, then all those voters that we registered in 2008, all those people we asked to take a leap of faith two years ago and really vote their best intentions, will become discouraged.  We will lose a generation.  I don't know about you but I'm, I'm tired of these periodic bouts of national insanity.   I'm tired of them telling us we don't have twenty three billion dollars to save teachers jobs but we do have 32 billion dollars for war. I'm tired of them telling us we got 32 billion dollars a war but we don't have money to extend unemployment insurance, and yeah, sure we know Congress is shutting down for the July fourth recess, but just let them eat hot dogs, and I'm tired of having weeks like the week I had a month ago where we filled a lawsuit against Arizona on Monday for making show me your papers the state motto.  Then we went down to beat up the Texas State Board of Education, who was having what can only be described as the Scopes Monkey Trial of social studies, and then having thought that we had rehashed the first half of the 20th century enough for one week, woke up to Rand paul wanting to debate the 1964 Civil Rights Act like it was a new idea.  Where are the people who can bring sanity back to this country, where are the people who can ensure this, this country stays on track towards hope and progress, but we have to come back to Washington on October 2nd together and demand the rest of the change that we voted for thank you and God bless I’ll see you in Washington on October 17th.

  transcript: (Host) We're joined in studio Justin Slagel justice legal co-host of the Justin Scott & Spiegel show / 98 rock their morning show.  We're joined the studio by Democratic candidate for governor, former president and CEO of the National NAACP, Ben Jealous and the reason Justin and it's, you know, kind of fortuitous that we have Ben Jealous joining us today.  He came in to talk about his ideas running for Governor to deal with the opioid crisis.  The Washington Post actually wrote the article on this but you come at a time, Ben Jealous, where we are suffering in the city.  We have had violence, unprecedented all of this year, but you come at a time when we have had a forty one-year-old beloved member of the Baltimore City communities that was shot and killed just a week ago, and this person was just leaving you know his job and Locust Point area, you're leaving a Royal Farms, shot and killed, and then we have the murder of 18 year police detective, detective Sean Souter, somebody who people have beloved person, not only in law enforcement but people in the community knew this person, shot and killed in an area, Ben this is how I want to start the conversation with you, in an area of the city at Freemount and Bennet Place over the last three years we have seen 11 shootings before the shooting of detective Souter, four homicides.  Ninety percent of what we're watching is opioid and heroin related so I want to begin there with you because this fight that you want to have for the state, of course, is a statewide issue but it really is dramatic here in the city of Baltimore feeding this violence, (Jealous) We have to get to a place where we're guided by what works, by common sense and by the humility to recognize that what we've tried in the past has failed us.  You can't incarcerate your way out of an addiction problem and yet at the same time, when you have officers on the front line who are seeking to make all of us safer, you got to give them every type of support you can the, that works.  Part of that frankly is to expand the Safe Streets program.  We got 200 neighborhoods in Baltimore.  We got 50 high poverty neighborhoods that also tend to have, be where the violence is concentrated.  We have safe streets in 4, in 4 neighborhoods, and we know that whatever neighborhood it is it brings down the shootings about 26% well  (Host)Let me reinforce that if I can Ben Jealous and I'm not sure how much Justin you're aware of the overall Safe Streets program, but in McElderry Park, we highlighted this the one safe streets program in East Baltimore for one solid year now, we've been experienced this spike in violence, for one solid year Ben Jealous there was zero, zero homicides in the McElderry Park and this program is why that happened I wanted people to know  (Jealous)That’s exactly right and so New York City has like doubled tripled quadrupled down they ran similar pilot programs and then they learned from them and they expanded them.  I've been to literally the largest and most violent housing projects in New York City.  They went 500 days without a shooting.  We can do the same thing here.  We've done the same thing here, as you know, we just gotta invest in what works and it upsets me I'll tell you because look, I've had two family members shot in Maryland in the last ten years.  One of them died, one of them survived and died not long after and when you're a murder victim family member what you know is that we need a, you know, we need to focus on the things that work and so you, you expand safe streets.  You deal with addiction, as you know, just with a recognition that poor addicts need what rich addicts need, they need rehab, not incarceration.  You recognize that we have a lot of addicts behind bars who are still getting their drugs. (Host) Easier behind bars then on the street (Jealous)And so you got to deal with the corruption that allows those drugs to get in there, but you also got to make sure that we have rehabilitation behind bars so they come back better, and then you have to figure out how do we actually rebuild trust between law enforcement and the neighborhoods they have, the neighbors they've sworn to respect and protect.  You know, our families, you know, go back to this same kind of cluster of neighborhoods in West Baltimore.  You know, my grandma used to watch, you know, watch your grandma's kids (Host) yes (Jealous) In the McCullough homes housing projects and my grandfather, what got him out of there was working as a probation officer, 30 years on the force here as a juvenile probation officer in West Baltimore and what, and what he would tell you is if we show courage today, which for him was often taking some of the youngest, sorry, some of the most violent young men in our city and inviting him into his living room to figure out how they get their lives straight.  We do better tomorrow (Host)But we had communities, Ben Jealous, here's my thing, we had communities then.  My grandmother lived on Cherry Hill Avenue, my grandfather, we lived in the areas where we were, where we were doing the public service work. you don't have communities anymore.  You have people, neighbors who don't even talk to each other who don't even know each other so we have this whole cauldron, Justin and, and Ben Jealous, of dysfunction that we're trying to bring what you elements (Jealous)and what we can control today we need to change and when it comes to the police officers, we got to get them out of their cars, walking the beats we got to recruit more from the actual neighborhood and we, frankly, have to be prepared to actually pay our best officers more so we don't lose them to Baltimore County because every time we get a great officer, Baltimore County comes knocking and, and, and, it's hard to say that officer, who's got to support his family, you stay in the city where there's a greater risk and we're going to pay you less (Host) As detective Souter shows us  (Jealous) And that's what makes his loss cut across, right. I mean you're seeing activists who primarily talk about police reform who are grieving over his loss (Host) They knew this man.  They knew him.  (Jealous)And he was a good officer.  He was committed to the, to the community.  He was a good dad, he was raising five kids, and the same people who are a threat to him are a threat to our families, to our cousins. (Host)Let me ask you, let's get back to policy for a second, because I agree with you.  We need to rapidly increase how we deal with opioid addiction arrests. (Jealous)Yes (Host) We need treatment on demand.  How do we pay for this, Ben Jealous, because at the end of the day, I've asked you on a couple different occasions, we need to fit within a budget, we’re not like the federal government, we have to fit within a forty three billion dollar budget.  How do we pay for this? (Jealous)We start by spending money better.  Incarceration is the least effective and most expensive way to deal with addiction.  I work in the social impact investment space where we fix tough social problems, frankly, through capitalism and, and we've created an idea we call social impact bonds in this movement.  The idea is that you spend money today on fixing a problem better, you save money tomorrow and so what we've said is we can, this crisis is as big as any public disaster we will face.  We have thousands of people dying every year.  The deaths from fentanyl are up 6x in the last 3 years.  Heroin has definitely (Host)It’s evened off, it’s kind of evened off a little bit (Jealous)Well, it's, it's up to 1,200 a year from like 200.  I mean that's not evening off we need to be bringing it down right, (Host) I mean what I understand is the fentanyl is really the issue. I mean, the fentanyl that we've seen is this synthetic opioid, is really the toxic element even more than heroin. (Jealous)Fentanyl, I know, it has recently surpassed heroin. (Host)Yes. (Jealous)Heroin was already high and has doubled.  They’re each over a thousand deaths a year in our state.  The other prescription opioids other than fentanyl are much lower but still very serious, and so we have to make sure that people get what they need when they need it.  the our lawmakers asked for 10 24-hour, 7 day a week crisis centers for people dealing with addiction across the state.  The governor gave them 1.  We need 10.  We need to make sure that in every corner of this state there are Rapid Response Teams if you have a loved one in crisis with addiction, you can call they can get to them and help for them to get to them that day. (Host)if you don't get to them that day they're using again. (Jealous)That’s exactly right in it or they die because they don't get, you know, the, the, the naloxone that they need.  Here in the city we've been forced to ration it.  This is a drug that saves lives, and we're rationing naloxone in Baltimore City going on six months now. So when you talk about how you pay for it, well, first we’ll spend money better.  Second, we will borrow a small amount of money, relatively speaking, from our rainy day fund, 10, 20 million dollars of a fund that's almost a billion  (Host)It's kind of pouring, it’s not raining, it's pouring right now (Jealous) No, that's exactly right.  This is what a rainy day fund’s for, with the intention of paying it back, A, by spending money better this is the whole social bond idea you spend a little bit today, you save a lot tomorrow, you pay it back.  The other, frankly, is that we need to be bringing more lawsuits against these drug companies for the crisis that they have helps spawn.  The reason that, that we've seen this dramatic increase in things like fentanyl that come out of a pharmaceutical laboratory or oxy, (Host)Mainly from China too (Jealous) you know, are that these are, you know, somebody created this product and they sold it and, and they're very comfortable, frankly, trafficking it in too many cases, and so we'll spend money better, we'll finance it internally and then we will also sue these companies and, and as we reap, quite frankly, the judgments and those lawsuits, or the rewards for spending money better, we'll pay ourselves back

  transcript: (Jensen) This is Brenan Jensen for the Chronicle.  The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People turns 100 this year.  The group's new president, 36-year-old Benjamin Jealous is the youngest leader the storied civil rights charity has ever had.  He was formerly head of the Rosenberg foundation in San Francisco.  We sat down with Mr. Jealous to talk about his new role, the Obama presidency, his group's sizeable 64-member board and other topics.  Well, you've been on the job what five months? (Jealous) Yeah  (Jensen) If you had to point to one change you feel you've brought the organization as it enters the Ben Jealous era, what would you point to and say this is the? (Jealous) I think, let's say two changes.  One is that we're back in the black, I just can't repeat that enough.  We're here today, I'm at a staff retreat setting the framework in which we will begin designing and rolling out big campaigns, and in the meantime we've begun launching a retraining of our field operation across the country which will start in just a few weeks in uh basic community organizing skills.  (Jensen) I could be wrong but I believe you're perhaps the first president to have an extensive background in a nonprofit world.  How has that been beneficial to? (Jealous) In this, if you will, modern era of nonprofit management, post Sarbanes-Oxley, certainly is a real advantag:e to nonprofits being run by people who really understand the peculiarities and best practices and winning strategies of nonprofits.  I think that there's been, in this financial moment, there's some second guessing about the common wisdom of the 1990s, that the best world renowned nonprofits were run by people who had nothing to do with nonprofits, historically, and, so, I guess I do take some pride in being a seasoned non-profit manager (Jensen) Any thought that the board might be too large or? (Jealous) We’re a movement organization when you look at other movement organizations like Human Rights Campaign has 200 people on their board in total, ACLU is 83, the Urban League used to be at 64 and when they tried to cut as much as they could, they got to 44.  So, on that continuum, I feel like we're towards, towards the right end of it.  The bigger issue with a non-profit professional board is the same with the staff it's just, you know, it's about ongoing training and development.  We're starting right now with the staff, I know that there's interest from the Chairman in continuing with the board and that really, you know, the question is shouldn't be does the is a board too big but that does it work well. (Jensen) We have an African-American in the White House, probably something your grandparent's couldn't even imagine, how does that impact, you know, your work and your mission? (Jealous) In many ways, it increases people's hopes and with increased hopes come increased expectations.  We have a generation of young people right now who are batting a thousand because the only big fight that they ever permitted themselves to be involved in was this election and, quite frankly, this is a victory of a young generation of activists just as much as it's a victory of a culmination of the hard work of activists over decades. (Jensen) How do you to measure your success or progress?  Do you have any targets like X number of members or raise the profile or what sort of? (Jealous) We have, we have multiple goals, you know, and one of those goals was to, or has been to, get control the spin in the media. We have 25,000 media stories, only one person working the national communications job.  You can't say that you’re really controlling, you have an influence, you know, but in the in the vaguest sense, and that's been going very well, you know.  We have other goals as far as resources, you know, and that's been going up well we're up, you know, twenty percent over where, where we expected to be last year. (Jensen) Well, some critics like to question whether the NAACP is still relevant in the 21st century and you’ve outlined what the challenges are, how do you tell people that yes, this hundred-year-old group is the group that should be at the forefront? (Jealous) We are uniquely well positioned to build consensus in this country for those types of changes, the struggles of the last century were primarily around enforcing civil rights, right now the fight for good jobs, to fight for good schools, the fight to end mass incarceration.  Those are political battles, not legal battles; they’re not about enforcing civil rights as much as they're about realizing human rights. To go to the same school is a civil right, to go to a good school, or, if you will, the same good school is a human right.  One requires enforcing a social contract, one, the other, requires extending and amending the social contract, and that requires a plurality of voters, and you don't just need it on the coasts or in the blue states, you need it everywhere.  We're in 1200 communities across this country; we're concentrated in the red states.  Our people in their communities are insiders.  The NAACP in town after town is seen as an organization that has had a positive impact on that town and so that combination of reach, geographic spread, credibility you know and the ability to build coalitions and pull people together locally is a unique set of tools for a century when the job is to realize human rights and to expand the social contract.

  transcript: (Host) We’re joined by Ben Jealous, chair, he is head of the NAACP.  I saw folks from the NAACP at the Republican convention, now here at the Democratic convention.  Voter rights have been a clear message of the NAACP.  What do you mean, Ben? (Jealous) What we mean is that this country thinks that it should be one person one vote, that we should be able to vote free and fair, and we've seen more states pass more laws in the past year, pushing more voters out of the ballot box then at any point in the last hundred years.  Our country is moving in the wrong direction and, you know, it's not simply a Republican thing, as we've seen Rick Snyder, Republican governor of Michigan, veto strict photo ID.  We’ve seen Bob McDonald of Virginia actually expand the re-enfranchising of formerly incarcerated people and say, and say to his folks, don't even bring me a strict photo ID bill or I will veto it it's an extremist thing.   It's a far right thing, it's, you know, and it's, and it's having a real effect on this race, and, and, and it will have a real effect come November. (Host) Well talk about what's happening around the country. (Jealous) So Ground Zero right now is probably Pennsylvania, where this strict photo ID law, which says that you aren’t going to be able to vote unless you show up with a government issued ID with your photo on it and so forth.  It has not been struck down, so its been struck down in Texas and struck down, you know, in several other states, but it's still in effect there, and there's 800,000 voters in that state who don't have an up-to-date current ID, and black voters are hundreds, are 100% more likely than white voters in that state not to have their ID and there's just no way we're going to get all 800,000 of them IDs in the next two months. (Host) Why do people not have ids?  Explain, well, why there is a disparate impact on communities of color and poor people and older people. (Jealous) Right, so there's, there's a whole host of reasons, right, one is that this ID has to have the same address, and so if you're a poor person on the margin in this economy, is really struggling with three jobs you often move at least once a year and people just don't tend to go to the DMV once a year.  So, you could have an ID, it just might not have the right address.  If you’re too poor to own a car, and there are a lot of folks these days that are too poor to own a car, you tend not to have a driver's license.  If you're a student who moves, I mean, think about when you went to college, right, did you really run to the DMV to get a, you know, a driver's license from that state, no, most of us just carried the one from home, so there's a whole host of reasons and then, you know, it could also be because they say that your id needs to have an expiration date.  Well, if it's a veteran's benefit card there's no expiration date, right, because your status as a vet never expires.  Many student IDs don't have expiration dates and so they put all sorts of technical things in there, but here's the real funny part.  In court they admitted there's never been a case of voter impersonation in Pennsylvania. Bottom line is this, if the law is not intended to solve a problem, its intended to be a problem and that's what we're dealing with the Pennsylvania.  (Host) Explain the history of voting rights here.  We are in North Carolina, Charlotte, one of the first lunch counter sit-ins after Greensboro  (Jealous) Right  (Host) The Woolworth sit in.  Explain what the history of literacy tax, of poll tax. (Jealous) So the first thing folks have to understand is because they've heard of the 60s civil rights movement and the 50s, well those, those laws that Chaney Goodman and Schwerner that Medgar Evers and so many others were killed trying to invalidate were actually put in place 50 60 years before that, at the end of Reconstruction to, to really ensure white supremacy in politics in the south, and they put in place a whole raft of laws, the grandfather clause, which just basically, you were grandfathered in if you were registered to vote before the Civil War.  Tests on whether or not you can read, tests on, you know, a poll tax, right basically, saying that a man who couldn't pay the tax could be bought, and they also put in bans on formerly incarcerated people voting, but all of these had hugely disproportionate racial impact and they disenfranchised black voters, and they got rid of black representation in the South.  What we've seen is that every time that the vote has been significantly expanded for black people, there's been massive waves of voter suppression.  It happened after the Civil War and the enfranchising of blacks with the 15th amendment to the Constitution, it happened after the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, and here it comes again after we break the color barrier of the White House for the first time with the largest, most diverse presidential election ever.

  transcript: Konst Hey TYT this is Nomiki Konst, we are here in Washington DC right now.  We're about to have a conversation about Medicare-for-all.  This has been something that Bernie Sanders has been pushing for years and John Conyers as well, Congressman Conyers.  We've been talking about it consistently on TYT politics.  Well, it looks like there might be a state where Medicare for all is possible sooner rather than later, maybe before the nation goes Medicare for all.  We're lucky to have Ben Jealous, the former president of the NAACP, former Bernie surrogate and he is now a candidate for governor of Maryland, and Michael A Lighty, who is the policy director of NNU, the National Nurses Union, a great friend of ours as well, and we've had conversations about Medicare for all in the past.  So, um, I guess the first question is what comes first, Maryland or the nation? (045-145) JealousWell, you know, look, we think we know that Congress is not going to act, and it's certainly not gonna act in a good way, right.  Donald Trump there have been times when he's praised the idea of having a single-payer system but he's clearly in the hip pocket of Big Pharma and the GOP.  So in Maryland, we kind of dug in deep and we realized that we actually have much of what we need to go ahead and move forward.  The people of Maryland, as I’ve crisscrossed the state, have made it very clear that we need to make sure that everybody in our state has health care.  We need to make sure, quite frankly, that we get the cost under control that they stop surging.  This is a major source of poverty in our state.  I've talked to 80 year old women who are back in the workforce because they can't afford their pharmaceutical bills.  It's, it's choking our small businesses.  It’s the leading cause of personal bankruptcy and it's in the top five leading causes of untimely death in our state, so we've got to act.  We can't wait for Washington and, as it turns out as Michael can talk about in greater detail, we actually can move faster in Maryland than we can in probably any other state.  Konst What kind of system does Maryland have right now compared to the rest of the country.  Jealous Right now we have an all payer system, and what that means is that our hospitals, while they can charge different rates from each other, whatever they charge has to be the same for every insurance company, and that makes it much easier for us to think about a single-payer system because we know what the rate card is for each Hospital. It's much easier to plan.  (Michael Leigh Speaking 213-358) Konst So with that being said, makes sense, but there's the politics of this.  You are in a primary.  Your, the race, you know, the primary is not for another year, almost a year, and you've got to defeat the Democrats and become the Democratic nominee, and then you have to defeat the Republican governor.  How on earth is, is this possible, running on Medicare for all, possible and then once you are governor, how are you be able to move that through the legislature. (428-630) Jealous We’re blessed in this campaign to be building a big tent of support. We start off with Bernie's endorsement, you know. We'll be rolling out six major unions, and frankly, some folks who supported some, some major endorsements, some people who supported Secretary Clinton as well, in fact, Eric Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, has been helping us raise out there and, and recently endorsed and so we've sent a signal that we're gonna do in this election what I've done in Maryland as an organizer for years. I was named Marylander of the year in 2013 because I was president the NAACP. In one year, I led the effort to abolish the death penalty, first state south of the Mason-Dixon to do so, and we won. I co-chaired the effort to pass the DREAM Act, first state south of the Mason-Dixon, and we won, and we also put organizers on the ground from the NAACP in Baltimore City and Prince George's County to help deliver the vote for marriage equality. All three of those battles at different points, we were told were impossible to win. We got them all done in one year by organizing. We have a big advantag:e in our state. You know, 2018 Maryland is, will be the easiest state for us as Democrats to take back from Republicans. Now, that's not, that doesn't mean that it's gonna be easy, but it will be easier than any other state because Democrats outnumber Republicans two to one in Maryland. Our party is very strong. 2014, we didn't turn out and the Republicans surged, but my campaign, my campaign manager is a guy who turned out 125,000 more voters in 2010. He ran the effort for the party he was the ED of the party and for me, former president NAACP, one thing I know how to do is to turnout unlikely voters.  In 2012, Van Jones on CNN called us the unsung heroes of Obama's re-election because we turned out 1.3 million voters, so we're building a movement of working families across the state. This issue is central, and we're confident that we can win this, just like we won all those other battles. Konst Medicare for all is polling very high, so it seems like it's a go-to for Democrats if you want to win elections across the country, you campaign on this, but you're the only Democrat right now in your race who is, is number one, endorsed by NNU but for Medicare for all is that that's correct? (648-722) Jealous My conviction in this race is that if Democrats run as as Democrats, we win.  We're the party of FDR and RFK and MLK and Shirley Chisholm and Barbara Mikulski here in Maryland. What all those folks have in common is they were on fire both about advancing civil rights and ending poverty and expanding opportunity for everybody and if we run in that tradition, there's no way that we can lose. It inspires people, it gives them hope because they know that we're going to turn around and fix real problems in their lives and this is a huge one. Konst You touched on this a bit and, and maybe you can answer this in more specifics, what if we passed Medicare for all in Maryland if we're not fighting to protect chip programs, where children, you know, suddenly don't have access to health care, what, like, what are the numbers? How many people will be covered? What are, let's get into the nitty-gritty here so, so folks who support this and want to go and convince the Republican family members who are for it, but don't see it as is good for the economy, don't see it doable, don't see it popular, like what are some numbers on that, that would, you know, that would play out if we pass Medicare for all. (Leigh speaking) (1055-1519) Jealous As you travel across the state, what you see is that there's real pain. Out in Western Maryland, right when I started my exploratory committee, thousand working-class folks, mostly white, show up six o'clock in the morning, fill up an amphitheater waiting for free dental care, you know. Then you, you know, travel some further up in Western Maryland, folks saying in their rural county, it's half their economy. If Obamacare gets killed, their economy will implode. The health care workers, doctors, specialists, all around a rural hospital that without Obamacare would implode. The flip side is, if we cover everybody then their economy grows. You know, then you come down to Montgomery County, the wealthiest County in the state.  I'm at a union rally and a white-collar professional who was actually with us on Bernie, walks up to me and he's bawling after this Union rally and I said, you know, please, like, compose yourself.  I give him a big hug, I wanna understand what you're saying. He composes himself and says Ben you said in there that when you were young, you suffered from a juvenile seizure disorder, I said that's right, and you said that your parents worried you would die at different points when you were a young child, when you were a young adult, because you didn't have health coverage, you know, you couldn't get the  care that you needed. I said that's right, he said, well, five days ago my girlfriend, a 52 year-old psychologist, world-renowned in her field who had hit a gap where she didn't have health care coverage, died of an epileptic seizure in her sleep because she could not afford health care coverage and apparently she had not shared it with folks, she was kind of carrying that shame to herself. The irony is her father's a doctor in upstate New York, and he had, and my friend had just had a conversation with his recently deceased girlfriend's father, he said looking at the death certificate, yeah that's right, that's why she died, asphyxiation from an epileptic seizure, but let's be honest she's not with us because she couldn't afford health care. And then you go out to Western Maryland, I was sitting in the back yard, standing in the back yard at the end of a presentation with 100 people who had gathered to support my campaign, and the kind of one real skeptic in the room was a guy who'd voted for Donald Trump, and he asked me where I was on Medicare for all, health care for all, and I said I was all-in.  He said, well, what are you gonna do if Trump won't support it, and I said we'll get it done here in Maryland. He says really? I said absolutely. He said then I'll vote for you and I'll organize other folks who voted for Donald Trump too, and I said okay, I got a question for you which I said why? You know, scouting headline like Trump supporter supporting former NAACP president for governor. He said look, he said, for me and for my friends, he said, we all work for small businesses.  He said I'm a finance manager in a car dealership and my bottom line is really simple; it's my people and it's my business.  Every year, I fear the same day, and it comes like clockwork every year. It's the year we, it's the day we find out the health care costs are again going up way more than we expected.In Maryland, we're talking they're up 55 percent just since the governor's come into office. They're going up to 33 percent again this year.  He said, and then I have two conversations I'd hate to have. One is with the owner, to explain to him that once again we're gonna ratchet down everything; bonuses, profit projections, all of it. Then he got all choked up, he said it's what the employees, whom I love, to explain to them once again when it comes to their health care, they will be paying more and their families will be will be getting less. He said my bottom line is my business and my people, neither gets stronger, neither gets healthier until we take the profit motive out of basic health care coverage. So, I'm a free market guy, if you want additional types of insurance, that's fine, but he said, you know, I've got a right to run a strong business and we can't do it under this current regime.  And the reality is the numbers behind that. America 5% of the world's people 60% of big pharma’s profits. Medicare, the overhead 3%. Private insurance 17%. You know, we, we have massive bureaucracies right now telling people what type of care they can get.  They're working for HMOs, they're not working for the government but they're working for HMOs.  We can do much better if we go ahead and pass this. We've got the will, it's across the spectrum in the state. We're gonna build the movement and we're going to get it done.  Konst So why is it that you're not seeing more small businesses come out? Why isn't the Chamber of Commerce in support of Medicare for all if it would alleviate this, this frustration so many small business owners have with healthcare costs? (1537-1759) Jealous Small-town Chamber members, no doubt, just like the guy I'm talking about.  The actual chamber itself represents corporations, really funny politics, lots of pharmaceutical companies paying their, their dues, but when you get down to like the local small town Chamber members, folks who belong to the Lions Club and the the Kiwanis, you can have a real, a real conversation, and all that they really want to know is can you get me a better deal, will it cost less or at least will it be more stable and you know will our folks be covered?  I spent six months last year trying to move a factory from Edmonton Canada to Baltimore. We were gonna put it on a block the rest of that block is pretty much just public housing projects, and there was a vacant sort of brown field that that we were gonna put a vertical farming operation, farm lettuce on top of shipping containers so it was a way to use this space that otherwise was pretty poisoned, and this Canadian entrepreneur, born in the US but spent his adult life in Canada, wanted to come back home, is having a family wants to build a family here, convinced that America has a more competitive economy, and then we started to look at the cost of taxes and they were about the same but then he realized taxes there include health care.  In here, it doesn't. He was willing to stretch a little bit to get back to the states and then he asked me the one question, which is, is this a stable cost scenario.  Is it gonna change suddenly?  I said honestly, health care usually does. Sure enough, you know, a few months later, here it is surging thirty three percent again. I said he said you know what, I can accept all of this cost structure but I can't handle the uncertainty. So now he's talking about moving his factory, trying to get closer to the US market. He'll move itfrom Edmonton to Montreal, but he's notgonna cross the border. He's not gonnacome to Baltimore.   Those folks in that public housing project aren't gonna be able to apply for those jobs, which frankly we were putting it there because we knew there were many folks who would qualify on day one, basically because our health care costs are so unstable.  That's part of what drives me.  As you know, I spend my every day  investing in small businesses, growing them into big businesses, you know ,that's what I do as a social impact investor in Maryland, and it was just outrageous to me that after all that work, we couldn't get the factoryhere, even though the employer was willing to accept higher costs. It was the uncertainty and the fact that health care costs surged so often that kept him from coming here (Lighty speaks) Jealous And one of the other things you can do, frankly, is unleash a lot of talent.  We have a lot of young people who should be in the startup business, growing the next great company, but they're staying in a dead-end job because they're afraid to lose their health care. You know, we have single parents who want to go back and get education, but their health insurance is tied to their job, so they stay there to provide coverage for their family, and quite frankly that hurts me because what got my family, my, my mom and my grandparents out of public housing in Baltimore and moving towards being able to provide a better life with that for the next generation, for my generation, was that the state of Maryland paid for them to get their public higher education, and they were in a place because there were two parents in the household, where one could provide health coverage for the other as they went through school, but now frankly with so many more single parents, as I'm a single parent, the reality is that you have a lot of folks who are, who cannot better themselves, cannot better their families, cannot provide better for their kids, simply because if they leave that job even if they can pencil out everything else they won't be able to assure everyone has healthcare (Lighty speaks) Jealous Frankly freedom and lost productivity because that freedom leads, in our Country, where we lead the world in innovation and a job creation, this is something that holds both back, and we need to unleash both.  So really, to have jobs and freedom, we got to have Medicare for all. Konst …you have you have a good how many months until your primary? Jealous It is June 26 to 2018 and we're rolling out endorsements steadily great piece just written by Bill McKibben.  Friends of the Earth has endorsed and several unions, starting with the nurses, the postal workers and we have several more coming soon

  transcript: Jealous Place where Bernie would call for the police to stop killing unarmed black men and women and I knew how, how loud those tears were here in Chicago, all we’d gone through and if there were any more tepid in the Ozarks when all of us were in a dead sprint across this country, trying to make sure Bernie won. I knew I would be a little off and which you can't afford, to be sure, I was getting anxious and then Bernie made the call and the cheers were just as loud in the Ozarks to stop the killing of unarmed civilians by the police as they were in Chicago, as they were Detroit.  In fact, they were so loud and so sustained, John, I poked my head through the window, curtain and I walked up to the left where all those guys, they must have been in the hunting club, in there deer hunting camouflage were clustered and half of them were standing on their chairs with their fists in the air, and I really didn't know what to make of it. I knew there were white men who stood for racial justice, but, you know, that cost my father his inheritance and I didn't think I would find a critical mass in the Ozarks ever, but there they were.  Bernie gets off stag:e he's running back to get a drink of water. I grabbed his sleeve, I said Senator, he says Ben, I said did you hear that?,  he said hear what?, I said the applause line, Senator, they were exactly the same as they were in Detroit and Chicago, even when you called for the police to stop killing unarmed black men and women, and he said Ben, I'm glad you stayed to hear that, that's the revolution in this revolution, and that's why each of us is called to be but here's the other thing, and I want you to pay attention to this because, you know, groups like Priorities USA are spending a bunch of money polling to try to figure out the obvious. I sat there thinking what just happened?  How did that happen? You know, the Democratic Party is good at this thing called identity politics, but we don't do it with everybody because, you know, women, they tell you, we'll go talk about the ERA even though it's the 40th year in a row and we still ain't got a plan, right, and Latinos will say, we'll go talk about comprehensive immigration reform and black folks maybe it's ending mass incarceration or it's bringing jobs back to the inner city, but though, when it gets to working-class white men, we haven't had much to say for like 25 or 30 years as we brought Wall Street into our party, but here's the funny thing.   The only thing they want to hear about is restructuring the economy, making it possible for us to all have access to the American Dream again.  Health care for all, ensuring that the minimum wage actually catches up with inflation, making it easier to organize, making things in this country again a pathway to prosperity, ensuring that all of our kids can afford to go to college without going into debt, and Bernie had done that for half an hour and just like any other group and the, on the left in the Democratic family, if you spend half an hour talking to folks about their needs and how you're going to address them, well, guess what, when you ask them to be an ally to somebody else, they're ready to do it.  Now, here's the rub as president of the NAACP, you know, I mobilized in 2012 our organization, we were credited with turning out 1.2 million unlikely voters in the black community.  The unlikely voters are always the poorest voters in our cities, in our community.  When I went home to West Baltimore from the Ozarks, the voters in the neighborhood, my own family members who are reluctant to vote sometimes, they were waiting for the same conversation that the brothers in the Ozarks were waiting for, they were waiting to be told how are we going to fix these problems?  How are we going to bring jobs back?  How are we going to make he thinks again?  How are we going to make it possible for our kids to go to school?  We do that and we will win.  That's what Christine did.  That's what Carlos did, that's why Roe was able to go to very progressive district and take out an incumbent.  That's why this nurse will be in Congress. (Moderator) Brother, that was so good. You are running for governor of Maryland.  We are running up against our time limits here, but I do want people to know, I want you to do one thing for me, will you?  Alright, alright you think you can do that in Maryland ? Jealous Oh yeah, oh yeah yeah, yeah, lets be clear. There’s Bill who’s running, there’s Danielle who’s running, but let’s be really clear.  In Maryland, Bernie won 36 percent of the vote.  This will be a three to eight way race.  All I gotta do to get to forty ,all I have to do is get to forty and we've won the primary.  Now, let's talk about the, our Republican governor of a state that's two-to-one Democrats to Republicans won in a year when there was the highest tide of Republican turnout we had ever seen and the lowest tide of Democratic turnout we can remember.  He won by sixty thousand votes in a year when 125,000 Democrats who had voted in 2010 did not show up in 2014.  We give folks a reason to turnout, we do what we do best and we organize and there's no way that in 2019 Maryland has a Republican governor, but here's the other part brothers and sisters. I'm an organizer. I've always been a community organizer.  I’m the son of organizers.  We do not, this is not about me becoming governor.  This is about making it possible for our families and our movements, the women's rights movement, the civil rights movement, the labor movement, the LGBT equality movement, all of our movements being able to govern, being able to have faith that our government reflects our interests, moves our families forward.  This is not me, this is us.  This is us.

  transcript: (Sway (host)) On shade 45 Denise in Las Vegas are you there Denise? (Denise (caller))I'm here  (Sway) Go ahead  (Jealous) Welcome  (Denise) I’m just disgusted that so many people are calling, saying that this is okay.  I just can't believe it.  I remember I got pulled over in junior high, well not pulled over, but we got stopped after, after a bus fight and it was like, I'm taking down police officers names, I'm home and I'm outraged, and so I can't imagine this happening to people on a frequent basis and people don't see that this could be detrimental to them as a person. (Jealous) We have eight year olds in this city who tease each other because they're stop, because one is a stop-and-frisk virgin because that, because the other eight year old hasn't been stopped by the cops yet.  We cannot raise a generation of kids to expect that they're going to get frisked when they’re children because then I turn around they’re expecting it for their children and we're going to be living like this forever.  Folks have to stand up and say enough is enough.  If my kid’s innocent, treat him like he's innocent.  If my kid’s a criminal, treat them fairly but treat him like he's a criminal, and so yeah, no, I mean, you know, this is, this is outrageous and it's heartbreaking to hear the mothers stand up and talk about their strong, proud, 18 year old sons curl:ing in the fetal position on the couch and crying, saying why the cops do that to me? I didn't do anything wrong, and when we have this much contact with the cops and you increase the likelihood that the young girl will get sexually assaulted, a young boy will be killed or beaten, um, you know, there's a lot of bad things that can happen when you got, when you have more stop and frisks for young black men and boys then there are young black men and boys in the entire city (Sway) Okay, President Obama on NAACP you guys work closely with the president?  (Jealous) Yes. (Sway) All right, how do you think how would you rate the job he's done as president up until this point? (Jealous) You know, as the first black president, walking in to two wars, a recession and a resurgent far right-wing populist movement that has called him everything but a child cot, you know.  I think the man's done pretty well just, just, just to keep it together, okay, um, he has done a great job for a man who's had to deal most the time with a congress that wouldn't do anything.  Um, he could have done a much better job if Congress was willing to actually, because Congress makes the laws and they actually appropriate the money and what we need right now is jobs investment, and Congress has held them over a barrel every time.  They let him get a little bit of money out to create jobs, and for the last two years said that's it, we're not creating any more jobs.  The problem is that, that is the playbook from the Great Depression that turned our country around and when you say to the president, we're not going to let you use the one playbook that the country knows works, that's where our anger should be right now. (Sway) All right Nicky you have a question right? (Nicky (co-host))I do have a question, since you brought up President Obama, many people say that he hasn't done enough for the black community and I know as the President he is the President of the United States of America, so, all citizens of color, but what do you say to those people who bring up that argument that he hasn't done much for the black community.  What should he be doing for the black…? (Jealous)Sure, you know the, the, this president has rebuilt the, for instance, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.  Why is that important, because we have southern states that are literally passing the first poll taxes.  We got rid of the poll taxes to hell strict voter ID requires you actually pay to get an ID before you can vote.  It will exclude in places, in some places, three-quarters of the young black men.  That said, you don't have an up-to-date valid ID, and voting is a right, so, it's not a privilege, so it's his DOJ that's going after it. George Bush's DOJ actually promoted that type of policy, they wouldn't have gone after that.  We had an increase in hate crimes, they are going after hate crimes.  They're also are taking on notoriously corrupt police departments like the one in New Orleans, again, something that Bush’s DOJ wouldn’t have done, so there's a lot of good civil rights work happening.  The president is the reason that GM is still in business.  Mitt Romney, you know, was, was very clear back then.  I'll, you know, I don’t want to get involved in campaigns, we’re a non partisan group, but, but there are a lot of folks at the time who were saying just let them die, and there's a lot of black folks who are employed by GM.  If you're in Detroit, it’s one of the few places where black men can still go to get a decent job.  So he has been very courageous he's meant but he, you cannot underestimate what he's been dealing with in Congress.  We had four hundred bills good bills passed in the, in the House when the Democrats were in control that couldn't get through the Senate because in the Senate, you need a super majority to pass anything.  The Republicans have filibustered everything, and so that's what we're dealing with right now.  So, yes, I think that the president could have done more if Congress would have worked with him.  I think that the President will do more, you know.  We have pushed him to be more explicit on the issues of racial discrimination and, at the same time, he has done more than any President in recent memory to actually fight racial discrimination.  Recently, Pepsi was, uh, just fined three million dollars.  They were using formerly incarcerated status to basically lock black men out of employment, and so there have been a lot.  He has really taken on two wars, taking on this recession and also rebuilding the entire civil rights apparatus inside of our government.  There's a lot of folks who have benefited from that in ways that they won't even understand for a few years.  When they look back in and realize that but for Holder protecting their voting rights and turning around their police department, they would be living in a very different place.

  transcript: (000-300) (Jealous) I asked on the way down here when was the last time we asked our national president and CEO to travel to a state board of education and no one could recall.  You are an important group. You have an important task.  Forty percent of the states in this country buy textbooks that are guided by you here. I'm here to represent the 221 branches of the NAACP in Texas, as well as the hundreds more in those forty percent of all other states.  I have received emails from people in states throughout the South and Southwest very concerned about what you're doing here.  They're concerned about the process, they’re concerned about the apparent disregard for your own advisory groups, from official advisory groups, they're concerned about the impact on the children, their abilities of the children to understand this country, how we have come to be as great as we are.  They are concerned about the ability of the children to compete on future national exams, having learned a view of history that is tailored in the ways that have been proposed. In summary, we are concerned about quality, not quotas.  We are concerned about the whole truth.  We want our kids to learn the whole truth not half of it.  Texas, the students, the students in those forty percent of all states that are going to learn to from these books must compete for college seats and jobs with students from all states, and from all countries these days, and they must arrive equipped to college or to take the SATs with a full understanding of our nation's history.  These teaks threaten to hurt their ability to compete on the AP tests, for instance. We also know from our work, from the struggle for civil rights and it’s important to understand that it was a struggle; it wasn't just divine inspiration as one of our faith leaders suggested earlier.  We have learned that it’s important that they learn about the struggles of all people in this country.  We take great pride, for instance, someone was talking about the Irish, that the Catholics were the group that benefitted second most from our drive to end the scourge of lynch mob in this country.  So in closing, I would ask that you just take a moment to slow down.  You've delayed once before.  If you respect your advisory boards, the people in this room, the people the stakes we're now talking about not buying these books because they're so concerned about the process, president elect, their process.(School Board Moderator) Thank you Mr. Jealous. Are there any questions? Mr. Bradley. (305-333) (Mr. Bradley) I appreciate you being here.  In your statement you received a lot of communication from folks of the concern about the ability of the children to perform on the international exams. Are you aware that Texas is one of two out of all the states that rejected to participate in national standards and national exams? (Jealous) We're talking about the AP and the SAT, and your kids will take that. (Bradley) Do you support Texas’ individual right as a state to have this discussion here in Texas or should we just go ahead and abdicate this responsibility and kick in on up to Washington and adopt the national standards. (356-411) (Jealous) We’re a, we think it’s very important for this conversation to happen here in Texas. I think it's also important that you understand that people in states across this country are very concerned because what you do here will impact their children. (Moderator) Mr Allen (Allen) I want to thank your for coming today and thank your organization for it’s over 100 years of service to our country, I believe it is 101 years this year, so that’s phenomenal.  What I'm asking is because I see coming from a national position so it appeared to me that you were speaking as though people were fearful so what are some of the things you’re hearing people say that impact what they're doing in their state if what we are doing here is so fearful? (450-520) (Jealous) Sure, taking the word slavery out of the description of the slave trade, taking out reference to the Declaration of causes in the explanation of why Texas seceded from the Union, and so forth. We would be happy if you can slow this down, we would be happy to have our state leaders actually to sit down and go through line by line, um but those sorts of things concern people very much they want to make sure that the kids know the whole truth.  (Moderator) Ms. Leo  (Leo) Well I'm sorry that you’re just getting involved in, that you're late in the process because we’ve been doing this for two years, but I want to know where slavery was taken out and what your source of information is. (539-602) (Jealous) Sure, we're talking about the teak, the change that refers to the title: of the trade, now calling it the triangle trade and our, and our branches, we can, we can get that for you I didn’t come up here with a chapter and verse.  I would be happy to talk after, that's the heart of what we are asking for.  Our 221 branches have been engaged in the beginning as is our state conference president Gary blood so they only call in the folks from the national when things get completely out of hand. (Leo) Okay well I'm just asking you because we need specifics if you’re going to come here and ask for specific changes. (Jealous) We’re asking for the time to have that conversation (Leo) Have you read standards?  Jealous Yes I have a national and so has our national (Leo) Okay and which teaks are missing?  Why do you feel that our students will not be able to pass SAT exams or AP tests, on what basis do you make that claim? I want specific standards that are not in here that you would like added so that our students may be able to pass these because you’re making these allegations that they will not be able to. I want to know which basis, how, what they, what are you basing that? (Jealous) Ma’am, with all due respect, pass is a very low bar.  We want your kids to be able to do the best. (Leo) Correct so can you give me any specific teaks that you would like added? (Jealous) We would be happy to, we would be happy to, (Leo) But you don't have those today  (Jealous) No ma'am, you know, I've read the entire Bible but I can't quote chapter in verse I’ve read all of this and I even endeavored to read the entire health care bill but what I've learned from my years is that it's best off to sit down, slow down, and have a conversation. We will walk through line by line.  (Leo) We have been doing that for two years (Moderator) Are there any further questions? Mr. Agosto. (Agosto) Mr. Jealous, thank you I just have some quick questions.  Would you say the stance of the NAACP is that these cables don’t represent, as far as your organization, the academic standards, and they will be acceptable in our process as far as as far as it concerns the NAACP. (746-825) (Jealous) Yes that's right and I think I speak for the entire of civil rights national leadership when I say that. I sat down with others with Janet McMurky and with Nina Perales. You know, all of us are Americans and we're concerned about the lack of description about the struggle that happens in this country to actually get us to where we are, telling of the civil rights history as it relates to cases brought on behalf of Latino children.  Our children need to understand when our country makes a mistake, what it takes to actually make the change to overcome that.  (Agosto) Do your raise the importance of knowing about the struggle in history, do you believe children should know about the fight of civil rights, I see you had mentioned, I read a paper in there, you know, there’s no mention of secession, and think maybe we tap on the iceberg with what the ideology and the fighting and the struggle, and we understand that of our children understand what we went through, what people went through for civil rights and even the NAACP. Do you find that important? (Jealous) Yes, yes, absolutely. We, you know, our country is a great country.  It's a great country because we as the people of this country have always fought to, over to, and struggled to overcome its greatest obstacles that the different groups have put in our way, and the civil rights struggle needs to be understood in its complexity. Kids cannot be taught, as was advocated up here earlier, that people just read principles and it suddenly changed. That’s not the way it works. That's not the way that, dare I say, it, a democratic society works. Thank you. (Moderator) Mr. Mercer (Mercer) Thank you for being here.  My question is, you’re talking about the SAT and ACT, ACT covers science, math, reading, and English and the SAT has verbal math (Jealous) and the verbal includes comprehension and large written sections, and if the facts in there don't comport with what the kids here are taught, if a kids trying to catch up with history in there because his textbook omitted the hard facts, this time the easy facts, then you are creating distraction for the student on the exam.  It has also been shown that when you cut out the telling of the history of entire peoples, or you minimize it and you select from it, but you don't talk about the struggle then kids are not inspired to achieve in the first place, that they lose interest in school and they don't even get there for that test. (Mercer) Do you support that this board voted again to celebrate freedom week k to 12 and as grade appropriate we have the kids understand the relationship between the declaration of independence written by Thomas Jefferson, the declaration of independence and its relationship and impact with documents like the Constitution, the Bill of Rights the Emancipation Proclamation that we discuss those ideas as we have them in our standards right now (Jealous) I think that discussing them is great and I hope that that's not confined to a week or a month as people often try to do with black history.  We're talking about the full school year. (Allen) I just want to ask you a question I don’t want to put you on the spot but as you represent the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People I find that, and I think you would agree with me, we try to be politically correct.  Sometimes when we sit here and we hear something like you've got mold in your hair. I don't think we recognize the pain in that statement Martin Luther King gave a speech called “all here and now” we want our history in its totality, all of it.  We want it right here in the state of Texas, and we want it done now.  You can't give me two more their kids two more 10 years from now and two more after that to say we finally have made it where we need to go.  I think that's what, I don't know, wasn't.  I don't like to be insulted and from your positions would you believe that that's the kind of language we should be using now that we got you in two spots but we only had you in one last year. (1220-1320) (Jealous) I think that that's the case.  I really do you want to move us beyond quotas get into quality. It's not about what is pc and what is factually correct. I'm concerned about the, if you will I was a fan of F Troop as a kid and I'm concerned about the F Troop-ification of our history. when you don't mention a man like Hank Cardinal at the Alamo, you know, then you go back to, you know, at the time that F troop happened forty percent of the cavalry was black.  Thirty-four percent of the Calvary was black, you don’t see any blacks on F troop. and you can't do what we did to blacks on F troop that were doing to these textbooks.  That's what we're talking about, were talking about that you know let's tell the truth as it was, not as we want to remember it to be. Let’s tell the truth as it happened not how it glorifies it if we tailor it this way or that.  Let's tell all the folks who Hendrick Arnold was so that black boys and black girls and boys and all girls of all colors can be inspired by him to serve their country.  Let's not omit him so they feel like nobody like him has served this country. (Moderator) Mr Bradley  (Bradley) I want to go back to an earlier statement that you made in the very first words of your opening and I think we're all sensitive, we got national media here and one thing that we want to do is be factually correct.  I want to follow up on Leo's earlier comments.  Her statement was that slavery, and having read the teaks, you stated that slavery was taken out of the teaks and the words trade triangle were reinserted, and we did a quick word search of the document that was adopted in March and could not find any reference to trade triangle, triangle trade from the word search just in world history but will continue to search slavery is identified as slavery both in teak number 7 C and in 4 I and we're going to go back to American history and work on that but again, we just want to tend to be accurate and I don't know the source of your assertion.  (Jealous) We will give you that side apologizing Lakes get least I think that's what venison (Moderator) Mrs. Nine (Nine) My other question is we are talking about the civil rights movement and the struggle and the outside agitation that had to take place, do you, uh, there's a section of our teaks that, I’m paraphrasing, that talks about minorities being given their rights by the majority.  How does that strike you, especially knowing that it was the Radical Republicans that were the ones that fostered giving certain rights to minorities. (1625-1740) (Jealous) Sure, it does not, we live in a representative democracy and oftentimes members of Congress come together and succeed in getting a majority of votes without having a majority of public opinion on their side and, you know, all that has been talked about these current times and how tense they are and how they remind people the early 1960s of Texas, for instance.  That suggestion, that is, that statement would leave a child ill-equipped to understand how change actually happened, how people are convinced, how pressure by powerful politicians like Senator Johnson to twist arms to get to those votes to actually happen.  It would also, um, you know, fail to comport, fail to comport with the reality walking into the Supreme Court and the reason why the Supreme Court was despised by so many people, dare I say the majority of people in this country in 1950.  So we have to be honest with our children, they need to understand what it is to have courage and the ways that you can win on the side of right even when the majority people oppose you.  That's why we have the Bill of Rights in the first place. (Moderator) Mr. Nunez (Nunez) Thank you very much for attending this board meeting, and thank you for representing your organization taking the time to come here  It is a very very important process and it will affect a number of states which will effect the teaching of a number of students nationwide so I really appreciate you being here.  I've got just a couple of questions for you.  A few years ago, I had the opportunity to go to st. Augustine Florida and learn of the struggle of a certain neighborhood did and the braveness of getting into a swimming pool at a certain hotel I'm sure you know what I’m talking about and their struggle.   Are events like is important for our US history book because it was a very significant point in time for the african-american population from this struggle for their freedom and we're talking the 1960s only 50 years ago now. (1855-2010)(Jealous) They are important, they help children understand why their grandfathers never were able to attain the rank, the top rank of the Boy Scouts, I stutter so I apologize but I was a boy scout so I know the ranks and it's an Eagles Scout, because you have to be able to swim to be an Eagle Scout, but if you can't get access to the swimming pool, you can't learn to swim, and it helps kids put in context of foolishness we still deal with today. Of course my office gets complaints from across the country.  I got complaints last summer from states as different as Pennsylvania & Louisiana about black kids being kept out of the swimming pool.  Warren Buffett’s sister had to bribe her city in Virginia in order to make it affordable because they were going to make the public's pool more expensive than the day rate at the Country Club to keep the black kids out.  The kids need to be able to put that into context.  All of our kids are beautiful and wonderful and should be able to go down to the neighborhood pool and we haven't even gotten to that perfect place just yet.  It has to be put in there.  It’s had a profound impact on our country as small as this is. (Moderator) Mrs. Cargill (Cargill) Mr. Jealous, I’m over here (Jealous) Oh,  I'm sorry, speakers always in place that's right (Cargill) Thank you for what you said. I really like what you said about the kids being able to all swim and I like that you're working on issues like that because you're absolutely right.  I've done a little digging because I like to dig through these teaks, I feel like I’ve memorized some, I did want to assure you that slavery as Bradley brought out that its cover twice in world history. I also discovered two places where the teachers will be expected to cover it in 7th grade and then three places world will be discovered in 8th grade and I did find the standard that we're talking about with the triangular trade let me read to you in 12v in eighth grade explain reasons for the development of the plantation system the Atlantic triangular trade and the spread of slavery if you do have an issue with that I would like to speak to you and your representative and see why that language is offensive but that language has not been taken out. (Jealous) Certainly that would still be beyond belief to talk about rum and sugar and cash and not talk about the people, but because people are so much more important the common phrasing is transatlantic slave trade and to change that to triangle trade for those of us who descend from those people who were treated like sugarcane is offensive but for all of us who believe in the principles of humanism and the value of humanity itself, I think would recognize the need to keep with the common phrasing which is transatlantic slave trade. (Cargill) Let me have you, talk to you about that. It was not changed, it was actually added by the board so there was no change, it was added, and I want to point out to you again that the role of  slavery is clearly given here in the instructions for the teachers and to the publisher to cover  (Jealous) and we're saying it's the primary purpose (Cargill) thank you (Moderator) Last question, Mr. Agosto (Agosto) One question, you represent one of the largest, most widely recognized grassroots organizations in the country, possibly the world, your basis is on the civil rights of the individual, and is your organization willing or ready to make an official statement that you stand behind your organization as far as that these standards should be delayed, should be analyzed based on the fact that maybe they do not adequately represent the  important significant contribution by certain minority individuals and is your organization ready to stand behind that? and also are you aware that I mean just, just the other day that Monday that California state appropriations committee, you know, they, they voted Monday recommending a bill that that they condemn, you know, that no textbooks are subject to curriculum changes made in Texas.  Is your organization ready to make a statement on that? (2326-2434) (Jealous) Yes, that's why I'm here, to ask you to delay this process.  We think it's, you know, this process teaches something to our children and sometimes our kids need to learn when you head down the wrong road the shortest way to get back to the right is to backup we're asking me to back up.  I'm here representing people in California who have been pushing for that.  The reality is we take our responsibility as the number one most trusted and recognized advocacy group in this country amongst all people, we take our responsibility to make sure that children are well informed very seriously and we will not just push as we are successfully in California. We’re pushing every single state that considers these textbooks.  We don't want to have to go there.  We’re here, we wanna push our country forward, not trying to keep it from running backwards. This, my mom was reading these teaks with me, a very well educated woman, says this is taking us in the directions with  the way I was taught in the 1940s.  That's why we're here slow down, back up and then move forward. (Moderator) Mr. Mercer (Mercer) Thank you for being here and I can tell you my last two merit badges in the Boy Scouts were not just for swimming but also life-saving, and I think you need the lifesaving badge to be an Eagle Scout.  I’m gonna ask you when you look at that jigsaw line, what's written in blue and underlined is what this board has added so could you support the question we have the section to talk about the philosophic influence/inspiration of Martin Luther King's I have a dream speech and his letter from Birmingham jail this board had a disagreement blue underlined and therefore you would agree with that that and that is very important.  (Jealous) sure  (Mercer) And we talked about the litigation cases, they are underlined. Brown v. Board of Education, Menendez v. Minister Edgewood ISD v. Kirby, those kinds of things also added by this board for discussion on civil rights movement, you agree with that too. (Jealous) sure (Mercer) Just want to make sure since I'm hearing so much not only from yourself but around the media again and they're saying that this board is done but a blue underlined means this board for the first time added those standards  (Jealous) Well thank you for that. We would like to still sit down because again, you know, as, you know, it's not about this piece or that piece, it's about all of it together, how certain things add up.  We’d like to have a conversation, slow it down. I’m speaking on behalf of thousands of people from this state and surrounding states. You perform an important service not just for the state but for the nation, and we're here to make sure that that service can be continued to be performed in a way that helps involve our children going forward.

  transcript: (LaChance) Hey it's Naomi LaChance with TYT Politics, I'm here today with Ben Jealous who just announced his candidacy for governor of Maryland. How are you today? (Jealous) I'm great (LaChance) So you announced your candidacy in Baltimore, what, why do you choose Baltimore? (Jealous) We chose my cousin's flower shop Baltimore blossoms.  It's a great name, it started just after the uprisings and it speaks to the yearnings and the, the power of the people of Baltimore and the people of our great state to move our state forward, no matter what else is happening, and that's what we need to be doing right now. You know, we've of course, we have to resist Trump and his horrible policies but we also have to get ready to move beyond resistance to actually move our cities and our counties and our states forward no matter what's happening in Washington (LaChance) And moving beyond resistance, what does that look like to you? (Jealous) It means, frankly, seizing the power that we have, you know, we as progressives for generations now have mourned the transfer of power from our federal government to our state governments, but in this moment, when extreme right-wingers control every branch of our federal government, it's time for us just to embrace what is and, and use the power in our states for good, to move our children's opportunities forward to move our, our state forward, our families forward, make it possible to actually put a high quality teacher in every classroom, or to hold police officers who have killed unarmed civilians accountable, or to ensure that everybody here has access to health care (LaChane) Current Maryland governor Larry Hogan, he's a Republican, he vetoed a bill that would insure five days of paid sick leave for workers and small businesses, saying it would be disastrous for the economy what do you think would be too much paid sick leave.  (Jealous) You know, the reality is, is that everybody who's working needs the same thing, right, you need a dependable schedule, you need a fair wage, and you need to know that when you're sick, you can take care of yourself, you need to have health care. Our governor had an opportunity to stand up for working people and he sat down instead. (LaChance) So this is five days, what do you think seems appropriate? (Jealous) Folks need at least five days.  I think most folks would say they need at least two weeks.  The reality is that you can get sick and your child can get sick, and no worker should fear losing a job because they need to stay home to take care of a sick kid or, frankly, not, be able to take care of themselves so they don't go to work and spread that virus to somebody else (LaChance) On a sort of similar note you've said you're in favor of a $15 an hour minimum wage what do you what do you see as the highest it could go? (Jealous) Right now, we have an opportunity to ensure that work pays again in our state. That, that, that every parent can go to bed at night knowing that just working a 40-hour week is enough to cover the basement, the basic necessities for their family.  The reality is that nobody wants a minimum job, more than you want a minimum house or a minimum car, um, but we've got to set up floor somewhere, and the reality is that the if minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it'd be at $15.  If it had kept up with productivity, it'd be at $19.  It seems to me like $15 is a reasonable place to start, so let's go ahead and make that happen for working families across our state (LaChance) You were previously a fellow at the Center for American Progress and emails when you came out in favor of Bernie, emails in the Podesta Wikileaks hack, showed them pretty unhappy with you having done that, maybe a little bit betrayed.  How far are you going to compromise in terms of engaging Democrats across and, and the left across the spectrum? (Jealous) I'm a proud progressive whose entire career has been grounded in my years as a community organizer and as a civil rights leader.  I have a track record of standing up despite the odds, despite the heat, to do the right thing.  I did that here when I led the state, built a movement here that succeeded in abolishing the death penalty.  I did that again in the same year here when it was time to actually help pull in black leadership to pass marriage equality.  I did it again that same year when it was time to again pull in leadership across the state to pass the DREAM Act, and I'm sure I've gone to jail for protests more than anybody else who's running for governor across this country.  The reality is that you know CA_ is a, is supposed to be a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization, so I'm not sure why my colleagues there, if they felt betrayed, felt betrayed by me standing up with, with Bernie. I'm a progressive and I stood up with a very, with a very proudly progressive candidate to push for the sorts of policies that we talked about at CAP as fellows.  So, you know, it's, um, this is, all you can do is run as yourself and for my entire life, I’m the children of organizers, I started out working as a community organizer when I was 18 and I'm going to run like the proud progressive community organizer that I am.  (LaChance) So a young black man Richard Collins III was stabbed to death at the University of Maryland.  I know, um, you attended his funeral.  So the University of Maryland did make some changes, but I know a lot of leaders have said they're not enough. What do you think? (Jealous) Leaders across the state right now are on a journey trying to figure out what is going on, that we've had two young white men stab black men to death apparently just because of their race just in the past six months.  One from around Towson went up to New York City, pulled out a sword and killed a black man.  One in college park pulled out a long knife and killed his fellow student. It’s like the story of Cain and Abel.  I commend all of those who have dug down deep and asked the question what more?  What more can we do?  So a lot of good first steps, but we've got to stay on that journey.  The thing that inspires me most, I was at his memorial at Bowie State, I was at his funeral, is the resilience of his family and the commitment of his friends and his classmates at Bowie State and at College Park.  Young people coming together across lines of race and religion to say we're going to move forward together, we're going to create the world that we’re destined to create a more inclusive, vibrant, productive place, we're not going to fall victim to the hate. And that's frankly where I put my hope. I put my hope with your generation. I put my hope with the young people rising up in this state for home frankly the history of division oppression matters less in shaping how they comport their own lives. (LaChance) Maryland Democrats have said that if funding to Planned Parenthood, federal funding gets cut, they will come in and provide that funding instead. a Planned Parenthood in Silver Spring was just shut down. How are you going to help ensure that people have proper reproductive care? (Jealous) My grandma is a hundred years old. She started her career working for Planned Parenthood in Baltimore in 1940.  My family has always been supportive and raised me to be the same way of a woman's right to choose and to control her own destiny and to, as well as the struggle to ensure that everybody who needs quality health care gets access to it.  Planned parenthood sits right at the juncture of, of both of those movements, of both of those needs.  We must as a state, in this moment, be prepared to provide quality affordable health care to everybody in Maryland, no matter what happens in Washington, and I commend my colleagues, frankly the Democrats at the State Capitol, for the leadership they've shown on this issue.  (LaChance) You are a professor a visiting professor at Princeton Woodrow Wilson School.  Some African-American students have called for Woodrow Wilson's name to be removed for the legacy that he represents, for segregating the federal government.  How should we engage with that history? (Jealous) I mean, I'm a visiting professor so my power on the matter is limited.  I've been very supportive of my students, both publicly and privately in their quest to get the, the name removed.  He was a member of the Ku Klux Klan and I, um, you know, agree with folks who say, you know, generally, like when, when buildings are named a long time ago, we should respect the history.  There are exceptions and members of terrorist organizations are one of the things that we make exceptions for. (LaChance) I mean how do you, how do you deal with being at that school then? (Jealous) The same way I think that anybody, I mean, you know, the reality with, what college did you go to? (LaChance) I went to Bard College. (Jealous) Have you dug into the history of the northeastern liberal arts schools and where their money came from?  You know, the reality is, I went to Columbia University.  I'm a Rhodes Scholar, um, you look at Brown University, it feels like it's miles away from slavery, yet it was funded by so. (LaChance) You’re at a school that's named after a KKK member. (Jealous) I'm at the, my school, teaching young people at today one of the few schools in the Ivy League where students are accumulating no debt, and the reality is that in our society, the way that we change things is that we engage, that we get involved, that we add our voices, that we add our support, and we keep pushing now.  When I was a student, we succeeded at Columbia in getting a center to teach about the history of people of color in this country, to actually include us into the, into the curriculum and ethnic studies department.  We fought that fight for 25 years.  If you give up and you walk away, the great victories don't happen.  So, you know, that's, that's how you change things, is you dig in and you fight.  That's what my life has been as an organizer, and, you know, and that's, what we as progressives are when we're at our best.  If you just sort of tuck tail and walk away nothing changes.

  transcript: (Cenk) So joining me now, the new Democratic nominee for the governor of Maryland and what, of course, progressives hope is the soon-to-be governor of Maryland, Ben Jealous. Ben, great to have you here and congrats on your victory last night. (Jealous) Thank You Cenk its, you know, we're pretty happy yeah  (Cenk) Yeah so Ben your victory breaks down into two parts and I think they are equally important and that's why we featured your race prominently on The Young Turks overall for the whole network.  One was the primary where it was a classic matchup of the progressive versus the more establishment candidate, and you come from the Bernie Sanders wing and you were a surrogate for Sanders.  You come from the progressive can-do wing of the party.  Your opponent unfortunately came from the well, let's not try things too much wing now that race is settled.  I want to talk about that for a second and then I want to talk about the really important race, you’re having the general election because that also is really important for a different reason, but let's just talk about the race that you just won.  So a lot of the Maryland politicians were on your opponent's side and they said, well, you're trying for too much change and they imply that you didn't have enough executive experience, which I thought was a little offensive given that you led the NAACP for five years and all the other organizations that you've led, but how did how did that get settled?  You know, tell me about the dynamics of that race and why you think you won that race. (Jealous) Well there's two questions there, how did it get settled and how did we win.  I mean, you know, how it ended was actually pretty good.  A lot of those long-standing leaders of our party had frankly called me before they endorsed my opponent, told me that they had cut that deal two years ago, that they had no choice and a few of them even said that they would, that actually hoped I would win, and so we, you know, frankly there's, we're a family here and we know each other, we respect each other and it was it's very easy to come together at the end of this.  How we won is the way that we will win again.  We traveled to every corner of the state and we listened to people early on, and then from that point on we talked to people about what it would actually take to solve the real problems facing their families in real time and we just did it again and again, talking about how we finally fully fund our public schools, talking about how we end mass incarceration and take the money that we save and use that to bring down the cost of college for young people and the cost of graduate school, and we talked about how we finally get our healthcare costs under control by simply doing what every other the Western nation has already done and by doing that again and again.  It worked.  You know, people, it doesn't matter and if you're in West Baltimore or Western Maryland, chances are the issues facing your family are the same. I mean there can, you know, be things around the edges and there can be a big local issue, but 80 percent of the issues will be the same.  (Cenk) What I love to dive into is the mechanics of how people won, especially if their progressives, so that the movement can learn lessons and can apply it to other races.  So your race was neck-and-neck for a long time, and, and people were not sure who was going to win.  And as it turned out, you won by about 10 points, which is a very comfortable margin in, in that context. So, what do you think were the different things that you guys did in your campaign, whether it was volunteers, or how you raised money?  I don't know, you tell me, that you think made a difference in getting that victory? (Jealous) The decisive decision for us was to spend time very early on pulling a union after union, environmentalist group after environmentalist group, big progressive organization and after neighborhood progressive organization, because we knew, frankly, how to win.  My campaign manager and I met when I was leading the effort to abolish the death penalty in the state, and he was managing the effort to pass the DREAM Act, and I became co-chair of that campaign too and we won those big victories.  We helped pass marriage equality, and we learned that year that the way to win in our state, quite frankly, is to get as many groups as possible to declare the motto of the three musketeers, and just say all for one and one for all, and we knew from the very beginning if we just built a bigger, more robust coalition than anybody else, we would win.  Now the risk that we took early on is I was just told straight up look man, you're gonna raise money for a campaign, you're basically building a bicycle.  A bicycle is gonna have two wheels; one of those are contributions that come from individuals, and, frankly, they're gonna tend to be rich folks and they're gonna be pretty high average donation, and the other is corporate contributions.  And I said, well, look, I'm just willing to ride a unicycle and if that means if we lose out to the bicycles, I will lose this race on that alone.  As it turned out, we ended up having more individual donations than any other candidate, and, frankly, more individual donations then all the other candidates put together.  99.9% of our contributions came from people.  The other point one percent owed, one-tenth of one percent, actually slightly less than that, came from trade unions and small businesses,  many of those small businesses were giving things in kind like food to the campaign from Busboys and poets, and we shocked people because we raised money faster than anybody else and we did it with the lowest average donation in the race, almost half of the guy running on the public option, and so we showed so you can win a Democratic primary in Maryland bidding 99.9% of your money from real people (Cenk) And, and Ben's campaign raised 3 million dollars, which is an amazing total when it comes from individual donations.  It wouldn't be an amazing total if it was corporate PAC money then you could raise that fairly quickly, but it was a bold and important and correct and progressive decision to not do that and, and by the way, one of the reasons that Ben Jealous got the endorsement of the Just Democrats, and it was a huge night for that organization last night as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, who was a Just Democrat from day one, the first candidate ever, and Ben Jealous won, so huge night for progressives all over.  Also, let's talk about your upcoming race.  Now, Larry Hogan, as things stand are, is a popular governor of Maryland and so the second reason why your race is so important is because there is an idea out there that if you want to beat someone like Larry Hogan you have to go towards the right wing and you have to be, just, you know, in the centrist camp.  Now, you're also defying that, you're saying no, I'm going to run as a progressive in the general election as well. I'm not gonna do any pivots etc, so if you win doing that strategy, it will be a really important test for the progressive movement.  That's why I think it's really important for all progressives watching this to make sure that you continue to support Ben because that campaign is a testing ground.  It's important for all of us, so talk to me about your strategy about how to win the general election. (Jealous) You know, look I've said from the very beginning, I can't zigzag because I have size 14 feet and I'll trip.  You know, we're just going to keep running in one direction and quite honestly, it's not towards the left, it's not towards the right, it’s towards the people.  I come into this as the former national president of the NAACP, and I know that when I worked in states, frankly states far more conservative than our state, to shrink their prison system more rapidly.  We did it with bipartisan support because we listened to people and we pulled folks together, you know, we got fiscal conservatives who were just concerned the prison system was growing too rapidly.  We got libertarians who, frankly, agree with us on a bunch of criminal justice issues now, and we got Christian conservatives to join with progressives to join with the civil rights community because frankly, they're in the prisons, doing prison ministry and they understand what few folks do, which is that we don't just have the most incarcerated black and brown people on the planet, we also have the most incarcerated white people on the planet and it's destroying their families too and, quite frankly, what they tend to have in common is that those families were too poor to afford their own lawyer, and so that taught me a real lesson when I was running the NAACP, is that when you run towards the people, you can create a new center, a center founded on courage and common sense and that's what we're doing in this race because, quite frankly, you know, having loved ones who are addicted to heroin or to pills, that's not a partisan issue it's a people issue.  Struggling to pay student debt, not a partisan issue it's a people issue.  Worried that your kids are not getting a great education at public schools, not a partisan issue but a people issue.  Worried that our tax system isn't fair, that it, you know, let's hedge fund managers pay a, a lower tax rate then their secretaries, while we have senior citizens on fixed incomes are having their houses foreclosed on in Baltimore because they can't afford their property taxes.  That's a people issue too, and so we're just going to run straight towards the people, and we're going to have courage to speak frankly, common sense, put real solutions on the table.  You know, Cenk, one of the gifts I had in my life is that a hundred and one year old Maryland social worker who helped train Barbara Mikulski also helped train me.  She's my grandmother and she told me again and again, baby, don't try to half solve a problem because you still got a problem.  So my idea with the people of Maryland is simple.  When I bring you a solution, it'll be for the whole problem.  We will talk honestly about what it will take and then we'll fight hard and we'll get it done.  What I'm known for in the state, the reason I was named Marylander of the year in 2013 by the Baltimore Sun and then endorsed by them again, quite frankly, it's because I've succeeded again and again and getting big things done in our state and that's what I'll do as governor.

  transcript: (Charitan) Obviously tonight there was a lot of talk about the special interest donations, this and that, in terms of Bernie really striking a chord with the African-American community, do you think he did something different tonight that might show in the results of New York? (Jealous) What we've seen is that the support with black voters continues to build.  You know, the most important split in this race, if you will, and that, you know, amongst voters our party, isn’t black versus white its young versus old.  It’s voters 30 and under, voters 60 and over, and what we've seen is that over time, those younger voters are turning more and more the older voters as they say to them why is it that you guys are so passionate for Bernie and what the answer they get back is he's the only one that we trust to actually give us a better future.  And so what we saw, right, was that as voters first got to know him in the Super Tuesday States, support was in the teens ,it was pretty low.  Then we moved into the Midwest a couple weeks later, it was up around 30.  Now last week, a poll comes out from the University of Maryland and the Washington Post says black support in Maryland it's at 38 points.  Why is that important?  Well first of all, it's surged over the over the two weeks prior. We got two weeks at that point left to go, now we’ve got about a week and a half.  Second, what you were seeing was that we were, we were actually, we had punched through the ceiling we saw in the Midwest, so my theory is quite frankly when we have more time, when we talk more about trade, and when we all and when folks really, frankly, listen to the young people in our community, we get more and more support.  (Charitan) Do you think part of the problem is, you know, right here CNN this morning you have an anchor saying, oh, well, he had a big rally but most of them are Occupy Wall Street members and NYU students, which I thought was kind of asinine to say.  Do you think that african-americans and to all people aren't really being exposed to the movement behind them because TV news doesn't cover it that much? (Jealous) You know, I mean CNN is a, is a, is a perplexing predicament for us because when you look at you know whose employees have donated the most to her campaign, Time Warner comes out number six . (Charitan) Seven. (Jealous) Okay, well, so then they've slipped since I saw it three weeks ago when (Charitan) They don't disclose that either (Jealous) No, no and so you know I think that's, that's been frustrating to us the spin seems to reflect that sometimes.  They have great people on there, folks who are your honest and hardworking, but there's a certain tilt to the overall network that leaves a lot to be desired.  There are 48,000 New Yorkers in the street; 27,000 the park, 21,000 in the streets, all there to hear Bernie.  We saw the very start of this kind of push here in New York.  She struggled to have 1,500 people into a theater in Harlem the next day in the South Bronx, and if you know the two it’s really one larger community.  We're over 18,000. What's, what's critical, quite frankly, is whether we can keep, we win when voter turnout goes up all over.  Her going negative drives it down.  We have to stay focus on our fundamentals just turnout, turnout rate. if we turnout those folks, this is done.  (Charitan) It's a good question because I've spoken with a lot of voters this week and they're all disenfranchised.  Whether, you know, there was a, there was a deadline in October to change voter affiliation. I don't know a lot of young people, white or black, that are paying attention in October, six months before a primary. Other, other instances are you concerned that because it's a closed primary here in other places because a lot of these states have arcane rules that a lot of people are going to be disenfranchised  (Jealous) One of the things I'm most excited about is, is what comes after this because, because frankly, you have all these young people getting engaged and they're realizing how broken our democracy is and our democracy, no matter what happens, we'll be stronger because they're gonna challenge the super delegate process.  They're gonna make it more fair if they don't get rid of it entirely. They're gonna challenge these arcane rules, they're really, they're quite frankly there to benefit the status quo, but we also have a lot of young people who are signed up to vote here and if they turn out we could shock the entire world. (Charitan) thanks Ben
